PREFACE 


By Bernard Shaw 

This book by Professor Wilson is one in which I should 
like every one to be examined before being certified as 
I educated qx eligible for the franchise or for any scientific, 
religious, legal, or civil employment. My own profession 
* is, technically, that of a master of language ; and I have been 
plagued all my life by scientists, clergymen, politicians, and 
even lawyers, who talk like parrots, repeating words and 
phrases picked up from one another by ear without a 
moment’s thought about their meaning, and accept mere 
association of ideas as an easy substitute for logic. They 
are often good fellows and even clever fellows; but they 
are not rational. And they are incurably addicted to their 
personal habits, which they call human nature. 

The main controversy in my early days was abyut 
Evolution. It was started by Charles Darwin, a great 
naturalist, who upset both the Evolutionists and the 
Edenists (now calling themselves Fundamentalists) by 
bringing forward an array of instances in which the changes 
attributed to divinely purposed ev olutionary developments 
could be accounted for by what he called Natural Selection: 
that is, by circumstances favouring the survival and multi- 
plication of whatever natural varieties happened to be 
fittest to survive in the general struggle for subsistence. It 
was as if someone had shown that the fact that most men’s 
hats fit them, usually accounted for by the belief that they 
were made on purpose to fit them, could be accounted for

o 

on the hypothesis that hats occur in nature like wild straw- 
berries, and that men picking them up discard those that 
do not fit and retain and wear those that do. 

Such a suggestion would have been received, one would 
suppose, as a clever jeu d'espnt, to be taken seriously only 
to the extent of its calling attention to the fact that along- 
side evolutionary development has gone on the chapter of 
accidents and of changes forced on living creatures by the 
need to adapt themselves to external circumstances instead 
of obeying the evolutionary urge. Yet in the middle of the 
nineteenth century it produced an intellectual revolution 
in the biological, clerical, and philosophical professions 
generally. They had been compelled on pain of ostracism 
and financial ruin to work, write, and think on the assump- 
tion that the apologues in the book of Genesis are state- 
ments of scientific facts, and that the universe is the work 
of a grotesque tribal idol described in the book of Numbers 
as God, who resolves to destroy the human race, but is 
placated by a pleasant smell of roast meat brought to its 
nostrils by Noah. Any baptized and confirmed person 
questioning this assumption could be, and still can be, 
indicted for apostasy, and sentenced to penalties as severe 
as those reserved for manslaughter and treason. The 
intensity of the revolt against this limitation among scien- 
tists, philosophers, and thinkers of all sorts can hardly be 
imagined nowadays. 

Unfortunately, when a reaction is produced by unbear- 
able persecution, people do not sit down to a judicial 
examination of their beliefs so as to retain what is valid 
in them. Instead, they perform the operation known as 
emptying the baby out with the bath. They do not weed 
the garden: they tear up everything that grows in it, 
flower and fruit and vegetable as well as weed, and throw 
them all on the compost heap. Much as the scientists and 



PREFACE 


philosophers (the best of them were the same people) hated 
the Fundamentalist’s God, they had never been able to 
dispose satisfactorily of Paley’s puzzle. If you find some- 
thing as full of purpose and contrivance as a watch, he 
argued, you know that it did not make itself: somebody 
must have contrived it and made it. Napoleon pointed to 
the stars and asked ‘Who made all that?’ ‘The only reply 
was: ‘ Well, who made the mak er?’ Such logic chop- 
ping is not solid enough to stand against the mass of 
facts which seem contrived and designed. When Charles 
Darwin pointed out a host of instances in which a semblance 
of design had been produced by the chapter of accidents, 
the scientists embraced him as their deliverer. They threw 
over not only Noah’s idol, but all the other Scriptural 
attempts to personify or allegorize a creator as well. 

They went further — far beyond Darwin, who was never 
a Darwinian. They lost their tempers if any one hinted 
that there was any purpose or design in the universe at all. 
They set up a creed called Determinism, compared to which 
the story of Noah was cheerful and encouraging. One 
of its tenets was a topsy-turvy view of Causation in which 
the cause was itself an effect, and could not help itsejf. 
Samuel Butler, a sheep farmer turned painter and painter 
turned philosopher, perceiving that Darwin had ‘banished 
mind from the universe,’ made war on him with all the 
literary weapons at his command, which were considerable; i 
but he was immediately ostracized as maliciously un- 
scientific. Challenged to explain the difference between 
a live body and a dead one, the physiologists declared that 
there was no difference. Not only mind, but life of any 
sort, was banished from the universe ; and Materialism went 
stark raving mad. The author of this book calls it Mechan- 

istic ; but the Materialists dislike the term ; for a machine, 
like Paley’s watch, is a product of purpose and design;

PREFACE 


and this the ultra-Darwinians would not tolerate at 
any price. 

The man in the street did not care. To him Darwin 
was &amp; crank accusing him of being a developed ape. The 
religious sects found Genesis and St. Paul more comforting 
than pessimistic godlessness. A human society which, 
very wicked arid evil in many ways, was redeemable by a 
blood sacrifice, and, since it was managing to survive, must 
be led in the long run by its saints rather than by its sinners, 

I could at least bear thinking of, especially when it was borne 
in mind that our human life was only a brief purgatorial 
prelude to an eternity of bliss. But a wicked, evil, cruelly 
disease-ridden world which was also entirely senseless was 
a horror beyond words. 

No matter. The most unwholesome food is welcome 
to the starving; and the scientific world gorged itself with 
Natural Selection. For the Bible was smashed at last. 
The thirty-nine articles were reduced to absurdity. People 
stopped going to church in all directions. Hell was 
abolished. Jehovah was exposed as an impostor whose 
real name was Jarvey. Science said so; and everything that 
Science said was true, and everything that the clergy said 
was false. Talk of emptying the baby out with the bath! 
Babies were emptied out by the dozen with the deluge. 
Herod’s massacre of the innocents was a joke in com- 
, parison. 

Of course this was great nonsense; but it occurred for 
all that among people who were mentally active enough to 
be capable of a revolution in thought. A handful of people 
like Butler and myself saw that Natural Selection, far from 
being, as the public supposed, a discovery of something 
new called Evolution,. was in fact a repudiation and castra- 
tion of Evolution, depriving it of its moral basis in faith, 
hope, and charity; but our view went beyond the com- 



PREFACE 


prehension of the public, and some of our conclusions 
seemed irreconcilable. Though we were as anti-Edenist 
and anti-Paul as the crudest atheists and agnostics, we were 
classed with them and at the same time repudiated by them. 
Rousseau had said to the Churches: ‘Get rid of your 
miracles and the whole world will fall at the feet of Christ’ ; 
but we insisted that the world was full cf miracles: for 
instance, the resurrection of life every spring was a miracle 
so stupendous that the cures of lameness and blindness, and 
even the raising of Lazarus of which Rousseau was thinking, 
were mere conjuring tricks in comparison. 

It was very puzzling. How could people who were 
‘infidels’ believe in miracles and go far beyond the Bible 
in wonders and visions and prophecies? Infidels were 
people who did not believe in anything: how then could 
they have the face to call for an oceanic credulity as to the 
vital possibilities of the future? They do not believe in 
God, these people ; yet here is this man Shaw telling us that 
if God becomes convinced that Man is a political failure, 
incapable of solving the problems raised by his own powers 
of reproduction and aggregation, God will supersede him 
by a new species as surely as the dinosaurus were superseded 
by Tom, Dick, and Harry, Jill, Jane, and Kate. What do 
■they mean by God? What do we mean by God? The 
thirty-nine articles tell us that God has neither body, parts, 
nor passions, and that we must accept the Bible as His 
'‘word, though it describes Him as having all three. We 
shall lose caste if we don’t go to church; but we shall gain 
it if we buy a motor car and drive in the country in it on 
Sunday; and, after all, the Smiths and Joneses have bought 
cars and have not been to church since; and no one has 
cut them for it. 

As a run in the country brings better sermons from 
Nature than most persons can preach, perhaps the cars did

more good than harm; but the balahce was not always on 
that side. When Ibsen showed that our ideals were often 
poisonous, when the Socialists showed that our morals 
and economics were out-of-date and stale , when the 
Evolutionists and ultra-Darwinists alike made it impossible 
for any instructed person to accept the books of Moses as 
the work of a competent astro-physicist, over went all the 
baths and out went all the babies. Vivisectors claimed 
that science acknowledged no morals ; plutocrats held that 
business is business and nothing else; Anacreontic writers 
put vine leaves in their hair and drank or drugged them- 
selves to death ; sadists and flagellomaniacs outfaced the 
humanitarians in the criminal courts; bright young things 
daubed their cheeks with paint and their nails and lips with 
vermilion, made love to soldiers, kept up their spirits with 
veronal tablets, and changed into battered old demireps in 
their twenties; adult suffrage tore the mask from the 
fabulous public opinion and democracy which Lincoln 
believed in and made the centre of his millennial hopes ; 
statesmen found that the way to the Treasury bench was 
to ‘stoke up’ public meetings with bunk, and get photo- 
graphed smoking briarwood pipes or nursing babies whilst 
convincing the bankers and financiers that they could be 
trusted to change nothing; dictators superseded parliaments 
all over Europe, proscribing their enemies like Sulja, and 
, organizing troops of young ruffians armed with irresistible 
modern weapons to impose their wills effectively: in short, 
all the aberrations that can occur in the absence of a 
common faith and code of honour occurred and are still 
occurring, including a monstrous war which no armistice 
can stop for longer than time enough for the disillusioned 
combatants to be "superseded by a new generation oi 
young dupes. 

This very one-sided statement leaves out all that we have

gained by our liberation from the pseudo-religious super- 
stitions and pseudo-decent taboos and pruderies that had 
produced the reaction against Jehovah. That reaction was 
so monstrously overdone that, being itself a reactic/n, it 
produced a counter-reaction which is now taking the upper 
hand. It is not too much to say that St. Thomas Aquinas 
has now a wider vogue as a fashionable philosopher than 
he ever enjoyed before. The Church of England, which 
disgraced itself utterly during the Four Years War by turn- . 
ing its vestries into Jingo recruiting stations, has redeemed 
itself by behaving very much better since the resumption 
of that war in 1939. Psychology, which had belied itself 
by treating belief in the existence of such a thing as a soul 
as quite as superstitious as a belief in the existence of God, 
is becoming really psychological, just as biology is becoming 
really biological. Even medicine is following the lead of 
Scott Haldane, and beginning to regard a healthy body as 
a product of a healthy mind instead of the other way about. I 
Butler, could he revisit us, would no longer find himself a 
boycotted crank. Even my own claims to be a biologist 
might not now be received with contemptuous incredulity 
by the biological profession. Obviously a playwright 
working on the Shakespearean plane in the great laboratory 
of the world with its uncontrived conditions, its innumer- 
able untampered-with animals (mostly human) under ob- 
servation, and its recorded history as I am, ■ must be a ( 
biologist. Anyhow he can claim to know as much about 
the origins of life as the professionals, this being exactly 

I said many years ago that the Holy Ghost is the 
sole survivor of the Trinity, and that it is far more scientific 
to describe Man as the Temple of the Holy Ghost than as 
an automaton made of a few chemicals in which some 
carbon got mixed accidentally, 1 was accused of advertising 


nothing.

myself by uttering paradoxes of &gt;the same order as the 
statement that black is white, which is not a paradox but 
a lie. Now that I am old and obsolescent, young people 
who happen to have heard about the paradoxical Shaw 
from their elders, and are tempted to read him, cannot find 
anything startling in me. If they have the requisite erudi- 
tion, they point out that what I have said had been saic 
long ago by St. Augustine and all the great spiritual leaders 
of mankind before and after him. They class me as a 
Quaker of sorts, and are not puzzled as their fathers were 
by the fact that Sir Arthur Eddington, great as an astro- 
nomer, is a professed Friend, that Faraday and Qarwin 
were members of religious sects, and that the now some- 
what forgotten Lucretian Irishman Tyndall, who startled 
the world at Belfast in 1874 by declaring that he saw in 
matter the promise and potency of all forms of life, is repre- 
sented to-day by De Broglie, who scandalizes nobody by 
demonstrating what was plain enough to me in my teens: 
to wit, that if a dissolved salt can crystallize itself into 
a solid stone it is as much alive as the nearest squalling 
baby. 

The Materialists, in fact, are faced with the discovery 
that there is no such thing as matter: a much greatet 
advance than their grandfathers’ discovery that there is no 
such person as Old Nick with his horns, tail, cloven hoof, 
and pitchfork. As to the belief of the physicists, which 
so discouraged Dean Inge, one of the best brains of my 
time, that the sun is cooling and the earth must therefore 
end as a frozen lifeless moon strewn with the bones of the 
Last Men, Sir James Jeans, our Superphysicist, has sug 
gested that the continuous slowing down of the heavenly 
bodies by the tides must finally stop them in their orbits, 
whereupon, I suppose, they will all crash into one another 
as disabled airplanes crash to earth, and form a giant globe

at a temperature never before reached, in which life will 
carry on its work just as it does on the floor of the ocean 
under pressures that no dry-land animal could endure for 
a moment. 

■ It is a great relief to me to find that even the choice 
spirits among the college professors (still a literally God- 
forsaken lot) are ceasing to parrot obvicfus anti-clerical 
nonsense in the firm belief that they are teaching science. 
Imagine my delight when I received a copy of the first 
edition of this book inscribed by its author as ‘an instal- 
ment of interest on an old debt.’ His name being un- 
known to me, I hastened to ascertain whether his chair 
was at Oxford or Cambridge, Owen’s or Edinburgh, 
Dublin or Birmingham. I learnt that it was at Sas- 
katoon, a place of which I had never heard, and that 
his university was that of Saskatchewan, which was con- 
nected in my imagination with ochred and feathered 
Indians rather than with a university apparently half a 
century ahead of Cambridge in science and of Oxford in 
common sense. 

Now I had noticed for some years past that American 
culture, which forty years ago seemed to subsist mentally 
on stale British literary exports, was more and more 
challenging our leadership, especially in science. When 
I learned that provincial Canada had drawn easily ahead of 
Pasteurized Pavloffed Freudized Europe, and made pro- j 
fessors of men who were in the vanguard instead of among 
the stragglers and camp followers, 1 found myself consider- 
ing seriously, especially when the German airmen dropped 
i bomb near enough to shake my house, whether I had 
not better end my days in Vancouver, if not in Saskatoon. 
Meanwhile I urged, as strongly as 1 could, the reprinting 
of Professor Wilson’s treatise in a modestly priced edition

myself: an overrated attraction commercially, but one 
which still imposes on London publishers. 1 

But I did not look at it commercially. I had an axe of 
my own to grind; and I thought Professor Wilson’s book 
might help me to grind it. 1 am not a professor of lan- 
guage: I am a practitioner, concerned with its technique 
more' directly ' "than with its origin. Professor Wilson 
described how Man was a baby, to whom Time and Space 
meant no more than the present moment and the few feet 
in front of his nose, until writable language made Time 
historical and Thought philosophical. Thought lives on 
paper by the pen, having devised for itself an immortal and 
evergrowing body. You will understand this when you 
have read the book; and I hope you will appreciate its 
importance, and the magnitude of the service its author 
has done you. 

Meanwhile, where do I come in? Solely as a technician. 
Professor Wilson has shewn that it was as a reading and 
writing animal that Man achieved his human eminence 
above those who are called beasts. Well, it is I and my like 
who have to do the writing. I have done it professionally 
fty* the last sixty years as well as it can be done with a hope- 
lessly inadequate alphabet devised centuries before the 
English language existed to record another and very 
different language. Even this alphabet is reduced to 
absurdity by a foolish orthography based on the notion that 
the business of spelling is to represent the origin and history 
of a word instead of its sound and meaning. Thus an in- 
telligent child who is bidden to spell debt, and very pro-

perly spells it d-e-t, is caned for not spelling it with a h 
because Julius Caesar spelt the Latin word for it with a b. 

Now I, being not only a scribe, but a dramatic poet and 
therefore a word musician, cannot write down my "word 
music for lack of an adequate notation. Composers of 
music have such a notation. Handel could mark his move- 
ments as maestoso, Beethoven as mesto, Elgar as nobilmente, 
Strauss as etwas ruhiger, abet trotzdem schwungvoll und en- 
thusiastich. By writing the words adagio or prestissimo they 
can make it impossible for a conductor to mistake a hymn 
for a hornpipe. They can write ntardando, accelerando, 
and a tempo over this or that passage. But I may hare my 
best scenes ridiculously ruined in performance for want of 
such indications. A few nights ago I heard a broadcast 
recital of The Merchant of Venice, in which Portia rattled 
through ‘How all the other passions fleet to air!’ exactly 
as if she were still chatting with Nerissa and had been told 
by the producer to get through quickly, as the news had 
to come on at nine o’clock sharp. If that high spot in her 
part had been part of an opera composed by Richard 
Strauss a glance at the i score would have saved her from 
throwing away her finest lines. „ 

These particular instances seem impertinent to Professor 
Wilson’s thesis ; but I cite them to show why, as a techni- 
cian, I am specially concerned with the fixation of language 
by the art of writing, and hampered by the imperfections 
of that art. The professor’s conspectus of the enormous 
philosophical scope of the subject could not condescend 
to my petty everyday workshop grievances; but I may as 
well seize the opportunity to ventilate them, as they 
concern civilization to an extent which no layman can 
grasp. Soviet me without further preamble come down 
to certain prosaic technical facts of which I have to com- 
plain bitterly, and which have never as far as I know been

presented in anything like their statistical magnitude and 
importance. 

During the last sixty years I have had to provide for pub- 
lication many millions of words, involving for me the 
manual labor of writing, and for the printer the setting up 
in type, of tens of millions of letters, largely superfluous. 
To save my own“time I have resorted to s horthand, in which 
the words are spelt phonetically, and the definite and 
indefinite articles, with all the prepositions, conjunctions, 
and interjections, as well as the auxiliary verbs, are not 
spelt at all, but indicated by dots and ticks, circles or seg- 
ments of circles, single strokes of the pen, and the like. 
Commercial correspondence is not always written: it is 
often spoken into dictaphones which cost more than most 
private people can afford. But whether it is dictaphoned 
or written in shorthand it has to be transcribed in ordinary 
spelling on typewriters, and, if for publication, set up from 
the typed copy on a printing machine operated by a stroke 
of the hand for every letter. 

When we consider the prodigious total of manual labor 
on literature, journalism, and commercial correspondence 
th3t has to be done every day (a full copy of the London 
Times when we are at peace and not short of paper may 
contain a million words) the case for reducing this labor 
to the lowest possible figure is, for printers and authors, 
-overwhelming, though for lay writers, most of whom write 
only an occasional private letter, it is negligible. Writer’s 
cramp is a common complaint among authors: it does not 
trouble blacksmiths. 

In what directions can this labor be saved? Two are 
obvious to any one interested enough to give half an hour’s 
thought to the subject, i . Discard useless grammar. 
2. Spell phonetically. 

Useless grammar is a devastating plague. We who speak

PREFACE 


English have got rid of a good deal of the grammatic in- 
flections that make Latin and its modern dialects so trouble- 
some to learn. But we still say 1 am, thou art, he is, with 
the plurals we are, you are, they are, though our country- 
folk, before school teachers perverted their natural wisdom, 
said I be, thou be, he be, we be, you be, they be. This 
saved time in writing and was perfectly intelligible in 
speech. Chinese traders, negroes, and aboriginal Austra- 
lians, who have to learn English as a foreign language, 
simplify it much further, and have thereby established what 
they call business English, or, as they pronounce it, Pidgin. 
The Chinese, accustomed to an uninflected monosyllabic 
language, do not say ‘1 regret that I shall be unable to 
comply with your request.’ ‘Sorry no can’ is quite as 
effective, and saves the time of both parties. When certain 
negro slaves in America were oppressed by a lady planter 
who was very pious and very severe, th.'ir remonstrance, if 
expressed in grammatic English, would have been ‘If we 
are to be preached at let us not be flogged also: if we are 
to be flogged let us not be preached at also.’ This is 
correct and elegant but wretchedly feeble. It says in 
twenty-six words what can be better said in eleven. Tbg 
negroes proved this by saying: ‘If preachee preachee: if 
floggee floggoe; but no preachee floggee too.’ They saved 
fifteen words of useless grammar, and said what they had 
to say far more expressively. The economy in words: 
that is, in time, ink, and paper, is enormous. If during 
my long professional career every thousand words I have 
written could have been reduced to less than half that 
number, my working lifetime would have been doubled.' 
Add to this the saving of all the other authors, the 
scribes, the printers, the paper millers, and the makers 
of the machines they wear out; and the figures become 
astronomical.

PREFACF 


However, the discarding of verbal inflections to indicate 
moods, tenses, subjunctives, and accusatives, multiplies 
words instead of saving them, because their places have to 
be taken by auxiliaries in such a statement as ‘By that 
time I shall have left England.’ The four words ‘I shall 
have left’ can be expressed in more inflected languages 
by a single word. But the multiplication of words in this 
way greatly facilitates the acquisition of the language by 
foreigners. In fact, nearly all foreigners who are not pro- 
fessional interpreters or diplomatists, however laboriously 
they may have learnt classical English in school, soon find 
when they settle in England that academic correctness is 
quite unnecessary, and that ‘broken English,’ which is a 
sort of home-made pidgin, is quite sufficient for intelligible 
speech. Instead of laughing at them and mimicking them 
derisively we should learn from them. 

In acquiring a foreign language a great deal of trouble is 
caused by the irregular verbs. But why learn them? It 
is easy to regularize them. A child’s ‘ I thinked ’ instead 
of ‘I thought’ is perfectly intelli gibl e. When anybody 
says ‘who 1 instead of ‘whom’ nobody is the least puzzled. 
But here we come up against another consideration. 
‘Whom’ may be a survival which is already half discarded; 
but nothing will ever induce an archbishop to say at the 
lectern ‘Who hath believed our report? and to who is 
&gt; the arm of the Lord revealed ? ' 

But it is not for the sake of grammar that the superfluous 
m is retained. To pronounce a vowel we have to make 
what teachers of singing call a stroke of the glottis. The 
Germans, with their characteristic thoroughness, do this 
most conscientiously: they actually seem to like doing it; 
but the English, who are lazy speakers, grudge doing it 
once, and flatly refuse to do it twice in succession. The 
archbishop says ‘To whom is’ instead of ‘to who is’ for 



PRhFACt 


the same reason as the man in the street, instead oi saying 
Maria Ann, says Maria ran. The double coup dc glotte is 
too troublesome. No Englishman, clerical or lay, will 
say ‘A ass met a obstacle. 1 He says ‘A nass met a* nob- 
stacleT 1 A "Frenchman drops the final t in ‘s’ il vous plait 
but pronounces it in ‘plalt-il?’ Euphony and ease of 
utterance call for such interpolations. * 

I can give no reason for the Cockney disuse of final 1. 
Shakespeare, accustomed to be called Bill by Anne Hatha- 
way, must have been surprised when he came to London 
to hear himself called Beeyaw, just as I was surprised when. 
I came to London from Ireland to hear milk called mee y ock.

printed, is plastered all over with letters that are never

The waste of time in spelling imaginary sounds and their

and French ; and so much has been written on the subject 
that it is quite stale, because the writers have dwelt onJ,y 
on the anomalies of our orthography, which are merely 
funny, and on the botheration of children by them. Nothing 
has been said of the colossal waste of time and material. 


though this alone is gigantic enough to bring about a reform 
so costly, so unpopular, and requiring so much mental 
effort as the introduction of a new alphabet and a new 


orthography. It is true that once the magnitude of the 
commercial saving is grasped the cost shrinks into insigni- 
ficance; but it has not been grasped because it has never 
yet been stated in figures, perhaps because they are incal- 
culable, perhaps because if they were fully calculated, the 
statisticians might be compelled to make the unit a billion

or so, just as the astronomers have been compelled to make 
their unit of distance a light-year. 

In any case the waste does not come home to the layman. 
For example, take the two words tough and cough. He 
may not have to write them for years, if at all. Anyhow 
he now has tough and cough so thoroughly fixed in his head 
and everybody Rise’s that he would be set down as illiterate 
if he wrote tuf and cof; consequently a reform would mean 
for him simply a lot of trouble not worth taking. Con- 
sequently the layman, always in a huge majority, will fight 
spelling re form tooth and nail. As he cannot be con- 
vinced, his opposition must be steam-rollered by the 
overworked writers and printers who feel the urgency of 
the reform. 

Though I am an author, I also am left cold by tough and 
cough ; for I, too, seldom write them. But take the words 
though and should and enough: containing eighteen letters. 
Heaven knows how many hundred thousand times 1 have 
had to write these constantly recurring words. With a 
new English alphabet replacing the old Semitic one with its 
added Latin vowels I should be able to spell t-h-o-u-g-h 
vdth two letters, s-h-o-u-l-d with three, and e-n-o-u-g-h 
with four: nine letters instead of eighteen: a saving of a 
hundred per cent of my time and my typist’s time and the 
printer’s time, to say nothing of the saving in paper and 
,J wear and tear of machinery. As I have said, I save my 
own time by shorthand; but as it all has to go into long- 
hand before it can be printed, and I cannot use shorthand 
for my holograph epistles, shorthand is no remedy. I also 
have the personal grievance, shared by all my namesakes, of 
having to spell my own name with four letters instead of 
the two a Russian uses to spell it with his alphabet of thirty- 
five letters. All round me I hear the corruption of our 
language produced by the absurd device of spelling the first

sound in my name with the two letters sh. London is 
surrounded by populous suburbs which began as homes or 
‘hams’ and grew to be hamlets or groups of hams. One 
of them is still called Peter’s Ham, another Lewis*Ham. 
But as these names are now spelt as one word this lack of a 
letter in our alphabet for the final sound in wish, and our 
very misleading use of sh to supply the d efficiency, has set 
every one calling them Peter Sham and Louis Sham. 
Further off, in Surrey, there is a place named Cars Halton. 
Now it is called Car Shallton. Horse Ham is called Hor- 
shm. Colt Hurst, which is good English, is called Coal 
Thirst, which is nonsense. For want of a letter to indicate 
the final sound in Smith we have. Elt Ham called El Tha m. 
We have no letter for the first and last consonant in church, 
and are driven to the absurd expedient of representing it 
by ch. Some day we shall have Chichester called Chick 
Hester. A town formerly known as Sisseter is so insanely 
misspelt that it is now called Siren. 

But the lack of consonants is a trifle beside our lack of 
vowels. The Latin alphabet gives us five, whereas the least 
we can write phonetically with is eighteen. 1 do not mean 
that there are only eighteen vowels in daily use: eighteen 
hundred would be nearer the truth. When I was chairman 
of the S poken English Committee of the Briti sh Broad - 
casting Corporatisn. it was easy enough to get a unanimous 
decision that exemplary and applicable should be pro- » 
nounced with the stress on the first syllable, though the 
announcers keep on putting the stress on the second all the 
same ; but when the announcers asked us how they should ■' 
pronounce cross or launch there were as many different 
pronunciations of the vowels as there were members 
present. I secured a decision in favor of my own pro- 
nunciation of launch by the happy accident that it was 
adopted by King George the Fifth when christening a new

liner on the Clyde. But the members were perfectly in- 
telligible to one another in spite of their ringing all the 
possible changes between crawz and cross, between lanch 
and lawnch. To get such common words as son and 
science phonetically defined was hopeless. In what is 
called the Oxford accent son and sun became san; sawed 
and sword are pronounced alike; and my native city be- 
comes Dabblin. In Dublin itself I have heard it called 
Dawblin. The Oxford pronunciation of science is sah- 
yence; the Irish pronunciation is su-yence. Shakespear 
pronounced wind as wined; and as late as the end of the 
eighteenth century an attempt to correct an actor who 
pronounced it in this way provoked the retort: ‘I cannot 
finned it in my minned to call it winned.’ Rosalind is 
on the stage ridiculously pronounced Rozzalinned though 
Shakespear called her Roh-za-lined, rhyming it to ‘If a 
cat will after kind.’ Kind, by the way, should logically 
be pronounced kinned. The word tryst is again so far out 
of use that nobody knows how to pronounce it. It should 
rhyme to triced, but is mostly supposed to rhyme to 
kissed. The first vowel in Christ and Christendom has 
tvj;o widely different sounds, sometimes absurdly described 
as long i and short i ; but both are spelt alike. 

I could fill pages with instances ; but my present point is 
not to make lists of anomalies, but to show that (a) the 
' English language cannot be spelt with five Latin vowels, 
and (b) that though the vowels used by English people are 
'as various as their faces yet they understand one another’s 
speech well enough for all practical purposes, just as whilst 
Smith’s face differs from Jones’s so much that the one 
could not possibly be mistaken for the other yet they are 
so alike that they are instantly recognizable as man and 
man, not as cat and dog. In the same way it is found that 
though the number of different vowel sounds we utter is

PRFFACE 


practically infinite yet a vowel alphabet of eighteen letters 
can indicate a speech sufficiently unisonal to be understood 
generally, and to preserve the language from the continual 
change which goes on at present because the written word 
teaches nothing as to the pronunciation, and frequently 
belies it. Absurd pseudo -etymological spellings are taken 
to be phonetic, very soon in the case of words that are 
seldom heard, more slowly when constant usage keeps 
tradition alive, but none the less surely. When the 
masses learn to read tay becomes tee and obleezh becomes 
oblydge at the suggestion of the printed word in spite of 
usage. A workman who teaches himself to read pro- 
nounces semi- as see my. I myself, brought up to imitate 
the French pronunciation of envelope, am now trying to 
say enn-velope like everybody else. 

Sometim e s th e change is an aesthetic improvement. 
My grandlather swore ‘be the varchoo’ of his oath: I prefer 
vert-yoo. Edge-i-cate is less refined than ed-you-cate. 
The late Helen Taylor, John Stuart Mill’s stepdaughter, 
who as a public speaker always said Russ-ya and Pruss-ya 
instead of Rusher and Prussher, left her hearers awestruck. 
The indefinite article, a neutral sound sometimes called tfie 
obscure vowel, and the commonest sound in our language 
though we cannot print it except by turning an e upside 
down, was always pronounced by Mrs. Annie Resant, 
perhaps the greatest British oratress of her time, as if it' 
rhymed with pay. In short, we are all over the shop with 
our vowels because we cannot spell them with our alphabet. 
Like Scott, Dickens, Artemus Ward, and other writers of 
dialect I have made desperate efforts to represent local and 
class dialects by the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet, 
but found it impossible and had to give it up. A well- 
known actor, when studying one of my cockney parts, had 
to copy it in ordinary spelling before he could learn it. 

* xxvii 



PREFACE 


My concern here, however, is not with pronunciation 
but with the saving of time wasted. We try to extend our 
alphabet by writing two letters instead of one ; but we make 
a mesS of this device. With reckless inconsistency we 
write sweat and sweet, and then write whet and wheat, 
just the contrary. Consistency is not always a virtu ej but 
spelling becomes a will-o’-the-wisp without it. I have 
never had much difficulty in spelling, because as a child I 
read a good deal, and my visual memory was good; but 
people who do not read much or at all, and whose word 
memory is aural, cannot spell academically, and are 
l tempted to write illegibly to conceal this quite innocent 
i inability, which they think disgraceful because illiteracy 
' was for centuries a mark of class. 

But neither speech nor writing can now be depended on 
as class indexes. Oxford graduates and costermongers 
alike call the sun the san and a rose a rah-ooz. The 
classical scholar and Poet Laureate John Dryden said yit 
and git where we say yet and get: another instance of 
spelling changing pronunciation instead of simply noting it. 
The Duke of Wellington dropped the h in humble and 
hospital , herb and hostler. So did I in my youth, though, 
as we were both Irish, h-dropping as practised in England 
and France was not native to us. I still say onner and our 
instead of honour and hour. Everybody does. Probably 
before long we shall all sing: ‘Be it ever so umbl there ’s 
no place like ome,’ which is easier and prettier than: 
‘Be it evvah sah-oo hambl etc.' 

I have dealt with vowels so far ; but whenever an English- 
man can get in an extra vowel and make it a diphthong he 
does so. When he tries to converse in French he cannot 
say coupe or entrez : he says coopay and ongtray. When 
he is in the chorus at a performance of one of the great 
Masses: say Bach’s in B minor, he addresses the Almighty

as Tay instead of making the Latin e a vowel. He calls 
gold gah-oold. I pronounce it goh-oold. Price, a very 
common word, is sometimes prah-ees, sometimes prawce, 
sometimes proyce, and sometimes, affectedly, prace. ‘ That 
is why our attempts to express our eighteen vowels with 
five letters by doubling them will not work: we cannot 
note down the diphthongal pronunciation until we have a 
separate single letter for every vowel, so that we can stop 
such mispronunciations as reel and ideel for real and ideal, 
and write diphthongs as such. The middle sound in beat, 
spelt with two letters, is a single pure vowel. The middle 
sound in bite, also spelt with two letters, is a diphthong. 
The spelling 1-i-g-h-t is simply insane. 

The worst vulgarism in English speech is a habit of pre- 
fixing the neutral vowel, which phoneticians usually in- 
dicate by e printed upside down, to all the vowels and 
diphthongs. The woman who asks for ‘a kapp a ta-ee’ is 
at once classed as, at best, lower middle. When I pass 
an elementary school and hear the children repeating the 
alphabet in unison, and chanting unrebuked ‘Ay-yee, 
Ba-yee, Ca-yee, Da-yee,’ I am restrained from going in; 
and shooting the teacher only by the fact that I do npt t 
carry a gun and by my fear of the police. Not that I 
cannot understand the children when they speak; but their 1 
speech is ugly; and euphony is very important. By all 
means give us an adequate alphabet, and let people spell* 
as they speak without any nonsense about bad or good or 
right or wrong spelling and speech ; but let them remember 
that if they make ugly or slovenly sounds when they speak 
they will never be respected. This is so well known that 
masses of our population are bilingual. They have an 
official speech as part of their company manners which 
they do not use at home or in conversation with their equals. 
Sometimes they had better not. It is extremely irritating

to a parent to be spoken to by a child in a superior manner;* 
so wise children drop their school acquirements with their 
daddies and mummies. All such domestic friction would 
soon cease if it became impossible for us to learn to read 
and write without all learning to speak in the same way. 

And now what, exactly, do I want done about it? I will 
be quite precise?. I want our type designers, or artist- 
calligraphers, or whatever they call themselves, to design 
an alphabet capable of representing the sounds of the 
following string of nonsense quite unequivocally without 
using two letters to represent one sound or making the 
same letter represent different sounds by diacritical marks. 
The rule is to be One Sound One Letter, with every letter 
unmistakably different from all the others. Here is the 
string of nonsense. An alphabet which will spell it under 
these conditions will spell any English word well enough 
to begin with. 

Chang at leisure was superior to Lynch in his rouge, munching 
a lozenge at the burial in Merrion Square of Hyperion the Alien 
who valued his billiards so highly. 

Quick! quick! hear the queer story how father and son one 
time sat in the house man to man eating bread and telling the

served by the carrier, whose narrower mind through beer was 
»sore and whose poor boy shivered over the fire all day lingering 
in a tangle of tactless empty instinct ineptly swallowing quarts 
of stingo. 

As well as I can count, this sample of English contains 
372 sounds, and as spelt above requires $04 letters to print 
it, the loss in paper, ink, wear and tear of machinery, com- 
positors’ time, machinists’ time, and author’s time being 
over 26 per cent, which could be saved by the use of the 
alphabet l ask for. 1 repeat that this figure, which means

PREFACE 


nothing to the mass of people who, when they write at all, 
seldom exceed one sheet of notepaper, is conclusive for 
reform in the case of people who are writing or typing or 
printing all day. Calligraphers intelligent enough to grasp 
its importance will, if they have read these pages, rush to 
their drawing boards to seize the opportunity. 

The first question that will occur to th%m is how many 
letters they will have to design ; for it will seem only com- 
mon sense to retain the twenty-six letters of the existing 
alphabet and invent only the ones in which it is deficient. 
But that can only serve if every letter in the twenty-six is 
given a fixed and invariable sound. The result would be a 
spelling which would not only lead the first generation of 
its readers to dismiss the writers as crudely illiterate, but 
would present unexpected obscenities which no decent 
person could be induced to write. The new alphabet 
must be so different from the old that no one could possibly 
mistake the new spelling for the old. 

This disposes of all the attempts at ‘s implified s pelling* - 
with the old alphabet. There is nothing for it but to 
design twenty-four new consonants and eighteen new 
vowels, making in all a new alphabet of fortv-two letters, 
and use it side by side with the present lettering until the 
better ousts the worse. 

The artist-calligraphers will see at first only an oppor- 
tunity for forty-two beautiful line drawings to make a 7 
printed book as decorative as a panel by Giovanni da 
Udine, and a handwritten sonnet as delightful visually as 
one by Michael Angelo, the most perfect of all calligraphers. 
But that will never do. The first step is to settle the 
alphabet on purely utilitarian lines, and then let the artists 
make it as handsome as they can. For instance, a straight 
line, written with a single stroke of the pen, can represent 
four different consonants by varying its length and position. 

* xxxi 



PREFACE 


Put a hook at the top of it, and you have four more con- 
sonants. Put a hook at the lower end, and you have four 
more, and put hooks at both ends and you have another 
four; so that you have sixteen consonants writable by one 
stroke of the pen. The late Henry Sweet, still our leading 
authority on British phonetics, begins his alphabet in this 
way, achieving at one stroke p, t, k, and ch ; b, d, g (hard), 
and j; m, n, ng, and the ni in companion; kw, r, Spanish 
double 1, and the r in superior. He takes our manuscript 
e and 1 (different lengths of the same sign) and gets f, s, 
and 7h. Turning it backwards he gets v, z, and sh. He 
takes our c and o, and gets dh and th. A waved stroke 
gives him 1; and thus, borrowing only four letters from 
our alphabet, he obtains the required twenty-four con- 
sonants, leaving twenty-two of our letters derelict. For 
vowels he resorts to long and short curves at two levels, 
with or without little circles attached before or after, and 
thus gets the requisite eighteen new letters easily. Thus 
the utilitarian task of inventing new letters has already 
been done by a first rate authority. The artists have only 
to discover how to make the strokes and curves pleasing 
to the eye. 

At this point, however, the guidance of Henry Sweet 
must be dropped ; for when he had completed his alphabet 
he proceeded to bedevil it into an instrument for verbatim 
“reporting, which is the art of jotting down, not all the 
sounds uttered by a public speaker, which is beyond 
manual dexterity, but enough of them to remind the 
practised reporter of the entire words. He writes zah and 
depends on his memory or on the context to determine 
whether this means exact or example or examine or 
exasperate or what not. After seven years’ practice Sweet 
became so expert at this sort of guessing that the specimens 
he gives in his Manual of C urrent Shor thand (published by 
' xxxil 



PREFACE 


the Clarendon Press) are unreadable by any one lacking 
that experience. 

This is true of all reporting systems. There are dozens 
of them in existence ; and they are all efficient enough ; for 
the debates of Cromwell’s Ironsides and the cross examina- 
tions of St. Joan are on record. Charles Dickens was a 
competent verbatim reporter before any «of the systems 
now in use were invented. Sweet’s contractions and 
guessings were therefore quite superfluous: what was 
needed from him was an alphabet with which the English 
language could be unequivocally spelt at full length, and 
not a new reporting shorthand. 

Now Sweet, being a very English Englishman, was 
extremely quarrelsome. Being moreover the brainiest 
Oxford don of his time, he was embittered by the contempt 
with which his subject, to say nothing of himself, was 
treated by his university, which was and still is full of the 
medieval notion, valid enough for King Richard Lionheart 
but madly out. of date to-day, that English is no language 
for a gentleman, and is tolerable only as a means of com- 
munication with the lower classes. His wrath fell on his 
forerunner, Isaac Pitman, whose shorthand he called the 
Pitfall system. Pitman had anticipated Sweet’s strokes; 
but he made their interpretation depend on their thickness 
and the direction in which they were written. Thus a 
horizontal stroke meant k, and a, vertical one _t. The 
strokes slanting half-way between meant p and ch. The 
same strokes thickened gave him g, d, b, and j, with the 
addition of r for ch written upward instead of downward. 
Thus he got nine letters from the single stroke, and would 
have got ten if an upstroke could be thickened, which is 
not possible as a feat of penmanship. Sweet discarded 
these distinctions because, as no two people write at the 
same slant, the stroke should have onlv one meaning no 

•xxxiii 



PREFACE 


matter at what slant it is written. Making strokes at 
different slants is drawing, not writing; and Sweet insisted 
that writing must be currente calamo: hence he called his 
script Current Shorthand. Thick and thin he discarded 
as unpractical for upstrokes and pencil work. His getting 
rid of these elaborations was an important improvement. 
The distinctions he substituted were those to which the 
old printed alphabet has accustomed us. In it the stroke 
projects sometimes above the line of writing, as in the 
letter 1, sometimes below it as in the letter j, sometimes 
neither above nor below as in the letter i, sometimes both 
above and below, as in our manuscript p, f, and capital j. 
This gave Sweet only four letters per simple stroke instead 
of Pitman’s nine; but four are more than enough. Also 
much of the pen work imposed by our alphabet is unneces- 
sary: for instance, m and w take twice as long to write as 1 
though they can be indicated quite as briefly; and p and q 
could be indicated by their projecting strokes alone without 
attaching an n to the p and an o to the q. 

I take it then that the new English alphabet will be based 
on Sweet, and not on Pitman, though 1 am writing this 
preface in Pitman’s shorthand and not in Sweet’s, having 
discarded Pitman’s reporting contractions as unnecessary 
for my purpose and puzzling for my transcriber. The 
designer of the new alphabet will find that Sweet has done 
all the preliminary study for him, and solved its utilitarian 
problems. 

What remains to Be done is to make the strokes and 
hooks and curves and circles look nice. If very young, 
the designer may ask me indignantly whether I think of the 
beauty sought by artists as something to be stuck on to the 
inventions of the pedant. In this case it is. An architect 
has to make a house beautiful ; but the house, if it is to be 
lived in, must be. dictated by the needs of its inhabitants 

xxxiv“ 



PREFACE 


and not by the architect’s fancies. The great printers, 
Jensen, Caslon, Morris, did not invent letters: they made 
the old ones pleasing as well as legible, and made books 
worth looking at as well as reading. What they did for 
the old alphabet their successors must do for the new. 
There is plenty of scope for invention as well as for decora- 
tion: for instance, Sweet’s alphabet has no capitals nor has 
Pitman’s. Neither has any italics. Since Morris revived 
printing as a fine art, scores of new types have come into 
the market. Morris himself designed several. 

The new alphabet, like the old, will not be written as 
printed: its calligraphers will have to provide us with a 
new handwriting. Our present one is so unwritable and 
illegible that I am bothered by official correspondents asking 
me to write my name ‘in block letters, please,’ though a 
good handwriting is more legible and far prettier than 
block, in which the letters, being the same height, cannot 
give every word a characteristic shape peculiar to itself. 
Shakespear’s signature, though orthographically illegible, 
is, when once you have learnt it, much more instantaneously 
recognizable and readable than SHAKESPEARE, which 
at a little distance might be CHAMBERLAIN or any other 
word of eleven letters. 

Other changes and developments in the use of language 
and the art of writing may follow the introduction of an 
English alphabet. There is, for instance, the Basic English 
of the Orthological Institute at io King’s Parade, Cam- 
bridge, by which foreigners can express all their wants in 
England by learning 800 English words. It is a thought-out 
pidgin, and gets rid of much of our grammatical super- 
fluities. The institute is, as far as I know, the best live 
organ for all the cognate reforms, as the literary societies 
and academies do nothing but award medals and read 
historical and critical lectures to one another.

PREFACE 


The various schools of shorthand teach new alphabets; 
but they are wholly preoccupied with verbatim reporting, 
which is a separate affair. Their triumphs are reckoned 
in words per minute written at speeds at which no language 
can be fully written at all. They train correspondence 
clerks very efficiently ; but they should pay more attention 
to authors and others whose business it is to write, and who 
cannot carry secretaries or dictaphones about with them 
everywhere. Such scribes can write at their own pace, and 
need no reporting contractions, which only waste their 
time and distract their attention, besides presenting in- 
soluble puzzles to the typist who has to transcribe them. 
I have long since discarded them. On these terms short- 
hand is very easy to learn. On reporting terms it takes 
years of practice to acquire complete efficiency and then 
only in cases of exceptional natural aptitude, which varies 
curiously from individual to individual. 

The only danger I can foresee in the establishment of an 
English alphabet is the danger of civil war. Our present 
spelling is incapable of indicating the sounds of our words 
and does not pretend to ; but the new spelling would pre- 
scribe an official pronunciation. Nobody at present calls 
a lam a lamb or pronounces wawk and tawk as walk and 
talk. But when the pronunciation can be and is indicated, 
the disputable points will be small enough for the stupidest 
person to understand and fight about. And the ferocity 
with which people fight about words is astonishing. In 
London there is a street labelled Conduit Street. When 
the word conduit, like the thing,, went out of use, cabmen 
were told to drive to Cundit Street. They are still so told 
by elderly gentlemen. When modem electric engineering 
brought the word into common use the engineers called it 
con-dew-it. A savage controversy in the columns of The 
Times ensued. I tried to restore good humour by asking 

xxx vi“ 



PREFACE 


whether, if the London University decided to pay a com- 
pliment to our oriental dominions by calling one of its new 
streets Pundit Street it would be spelt Ponduit Street. I 
had better have said nothing ; for I was instantly assailed as 
a profane wretch trifling with a sacred subject. English- 
men may yet kill one another and bomb their cities into 
ruin to decide whether v-a-s-e spells vawz »r vahz or vaiz. 
Cawtholic or Kahtholic may convulse Ireland when the 
national question is dead and buried. We shall all agree v 
that h-e-i-g-h-t is an orthographic monstrosity; but when 
it is abolished and we have to decide whether the official 
pronunciation shall be hite or hyth, there will probably be 
a sanguinary class war; for in this case the proletarian 
custom is more logical than the Oxford one. 

Still, we must take that risk. If the introduction of an 
English alphabet for the English language costs a civil 
war, or even, as the introduction of summer time did, a 
world war, I shall not grudge it. The waste of war is 
negligible in comparison to the daily waste of trying to 
communicate with one another in English through an 
alphabet with sixteen letters missing. That must be 
remedied, come what may.

AUTHOR’S NOTE 


In this small volume I have attempted i philosophical 
exposition of language. To have called it the psychology, 
or the science, of language would have been more in the 
fashion of the times, but I choose ‘philosophy’ as being 
both the more accurate and the more comprehensive term. 

I have treated language as one step or cycle in the general 
evolution of the world, a cycle which includes the follow- 
ing phases: the emergence of conscious mind in the world 
and the new problem that emerged with it; the birth of 
language in answer to this problem; the materials from 
which language was made; the metamorphoses it under- 
went in reaching its final form; its structure in relation 
to space and time ; and its unique character among other 
phenomena of the world. A large undertaking, one might 
say, for so small a volume; but whether I have failed or 
succeeded does not depend upon the size of the book. 

I have avoided technical terms wherever that could be 
done without impairing the adequacy of the treatment, 
partly from personal preference, and partly to avoid placing 
stumbling-blocks of that sort in the way of the non- 
specialist readers who might be interested in the subject. 
But though i have made the treatment objective and con- 
crete in order to make it as simple and clear as possible, I 
have not wittingly sacrificed anything in order to make it 
popular. Whatever imperfections may be found in the 
treatment will be due to other causes than the concrete 
diction. 

I wish to acknowledge my great indebtedness to my

CLEARING THE WAY 




CHAPTER I

THE AIM, AND THE METHOD OF TREATMENT 

But that same Where (Space) , with its brother When (Time) , 
are from the first the master-colours of our Dream-Grotto ; the 
Canvas (the warp and woof thereof) whereon all our Dreams 
and Life-Visions are painted. — Carlyle, Sartor Resartus, 1830. 

When Kant in his investigation of the nature and 
validity of human knowledge in the Critique of Pure 
Reason (1781) undertook an examination of the nature 
of Space and Time as the starting point in the discus- 
sion, he struck the path which all fruitful philosophical 
investigation has followed since. Since Space and Time 
are the two ‘forms’ within which the whole system of 
life and nature unfolds itself to the human mind, and^ 
are at the same time the ‘ warp and woof’ on which maifl 
elaborates his mental sense-picture of the world, an 
examination of these two sense-forms should be the self- 
evident starting point in any true cosmic philosophy. 
Yet it seems to have taken something more than a cen- 
tury for the full significance of Kant’s method to sink 
into the general philosophical consciousness, and it is 
only in our own time that its fruits have begun to 
mature. What strikes one in the philosophical writ- 
ings of the present century, whether starting from 



CLEARING THE WAY 


mathematics, or science, or pure speculation, is the 
common assumption in all of them that some exposition 
of Space and Time must form the foundation of any 
adequate treatment of the nature of the world, the 
human mind, and the structure of human knowledge. 
The title of ’Professor Alexander’s book, Space, Time, 
and Deity (1920), is symbolic of the modem point of 
view. 

From these modem philosophical treatises, however, 
one significant human phenomenon has been omitted — 
language * So far as 1 know no attempt has been made 
to explore the nature of language in relation to space 
and time. And yet among the ‘novelties’ which 
‘emerged’ to actuality with man’s emergence from the 
realm of nature into the realm of free mind, language 
is the most distinctive and significant. It is the one 
unique human instrument which man has designed for 
the purpose of elaborating within his own mind an 
actual mental picture of the material world of space and 
time in which he lives. By means of these designed 
symbols of language he has built up, and is still building 
up within his own mind a space-time picture of the 
space-time world; and since the space-time mental 
picture elaborated by language is the approximating 
image or counterpart of the actual space-time world, 
there must be a close correspondence between the 
structure of language and the structure of the world 
which language images. It seems probable, therefore, 
that an examination of the structure and significance of 



THE AIM, AND- THE METHOD OF TREATMENT 

language in relation to Space and Time may bring to 
light certain characteristics of language, and of the 
human mind that created it, that are not otherwise 
apparent. It is in this hope that the present investi- 
gation has been undertaken. 

To work the problem out adequately, however, some 
preliminary clearing of the way will be necessary. This 
preliminary work will include three things : first, a very 
brief statement and exposition of the old Hebrew theory 
of language o rigin ; second, a short reference to Plato’s 
„ theory as being the first freely scientific and radical 
treatment of the question ; and third, an outline of the 
development of modem language theory from the pub- 
lication of Herder’s radical essay in ijyi to the publi- 
cation of Darwin’s Descen t of Man in 1871, when the 
stream of modem philosophic thought regarding the 
origin and meaning of language was deflected so vio- 
lently from its natural course that it has not recovered ' 
since. 

Because of this deflection I shall take 1871 as the 
starting point in time for the development of my own 
view. In this, the main part of the work, I shall give 
first of all a statement and criticism of Darwin’s view, 
and then, using this as a logical starting point, I shall 
attempt a new philosophical exposition of the origin 
and structure of language in relation to the two sense- 
forms of Space and Time.

CHAPTER II 


TWO OLD-WORLD THEORIES OF LANGUAGE 

i. The Genesis Theory (c. 9^0 B.c.) 

Adam’s first task was giving names to natural Appearances; 
what is ours still but a continuation of the same? — Carlyle, 
Sartor Resarlus, 1830. 

What is now usually known as the ‘external divine- 
origin theory’ of language — a misnomer which arose 
from erroneous theological expositions of the narrative 
given in the early chapters of Genesis — has still an in- 
terest for the modern student; first, because of the 
prolonged influence which it has had upon language 
theory' in the Western world; and s econd , because of 
certain significant facts regarding language which an 
understanding reader still finds in that old story of 
language-origin, to say nothing of the poetic attractive- 
ness of the story itself. 

The Hebrew writer of the Genesis narrative had 
observed the fact that of the gifts which God had be- 
stowed on man language was one of the most significant. 
Man had come into possession of the unique power of 
naming and classifying the things of the world ; and in 

6 



TWO OLD-WORLD THEORIES OF LANGUAGE 

attempting an explanation of how this naming process 
was actually accomplished that early writer put it in the 
following manner : ‘ And o ut of the . ground the Lord 
God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of 
the air ; and brought them unta Adam to see what he 
would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every 
living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam 
gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and 
to every beast of the field . ’ That is the Hebrew writer’s 
brief and naive story of the birth of language ;Ja story 
which the modem child of ten years will still accept at 
literal face value, which the man of twenty who puts 
away childish things will reject, and which the philoso- 
pher of forty, who has grown in discernment as well 
as in knowledge, will re-accept with some surprise at 
the amount of factual truth contained in it. We do not 
think now, of course, that the naming of living things 
in the world happened in such a summary matter-of-fact 
fashion as that, and yet there are three things in this old 
account that have significance still to the modern scien- . 
tist, despite the new views about language which have 
become orthodox since 1871. • 

First. Whether it was that the animals were brought ' 
to man, or that man went to the animals, or that they 
mutually confronted each other — the method of early 
poetic statement of the fact matters little — the result 
was that man did name the animals ; and the fact of his 
naming them indicated that he had come into possession 

of this unique power of language which the animals 

• 

7 



CLEARING THE WAY 


apparently did not have, because they had not given 
names to themselves or to one another. Furthermore, 
this record of man’s having named the animals of the 
world was written some three thousand odd years ago, 
and the animals have not yet made any start at naming 
themselves. This difference between man and the 
animals as evidenced in man’s power of giving names, 
and thus making explicit classification of things, is a 
unique difference between the two, a difference whose 
significance has not yet been clearly brought out in 
modem discussions of the subject. In fact, since 
Darwin’s formulation of the evolutionary theory in 
reference to man in 1871, the difference has been 
persistently either obscured or denied altogether. 

Second. According to this old writer’s account, 
man’s first interest was with the world of living things 
rather than with insentient life or inanimate nature. 
‘Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the 
air, and to every beast of the field.’ No mention is 
made of the naming of trees, or plants, or inanimate 
objects. This furnishes no conclusive evidence, of 
course, of the actual order in which man named the 
things of the world; but the things which the first 
writer observed as having been named by Adam were 
very probably the things that first interested man and 
induced him to mark their differences by giving them 
names. At all events, the passage has interest as giving 
us one of the earliest records of man’s first impression 
about the matter. 



TWO OLD-WORLD THEORIES OF LANGUAGE 




Third. This writer saw also that when the name was » 
once given to the animal it stuck to him. ‘ Whatsoever 
name Adam called every living creature, that was the 
name thereof.’ Some of these names given in the ge- 
mote beginnings of the Semitic language, long before 
the Genesis record was written, have, as a nuftter of fact, 
stuck to these animals down to the present time ; though 
countless generations of the animals themselves have 
come into being and disappeared again in a continuously 
vanishing stream. ) The giving of the name was thus the 
introduction of a new element into the world, the 
element of permanence which persists through the series 
of un-permanent things. This permanent element, as 
I hope to show later, belongs in its explicit form to the 
mind of man alone, and takes on its adequate outward 
form in language. 

In interpreting the old Genesis story in this explicit 
modem way one may be guilty of discovering more in 
it than the author intentionally put there; though one 
who has been trained in the literalism of Western 
thought and expression is seldom sure whether he is 
finding too much or too little in even the simplest ob- 
jective symbolism of the East, as in the older portions 
of the Bible. In any case, to have observed and re- 
corded the fact of this sticking power of names in con- 
trast to the vanishing series of things that are named, 
was a distinct achievement or lucky hit for so early a 
thinker and, when adequately interpreted, turns out 
to be a permanent contribution to the philosophy of 



CLEARING THE WAY 


language. But we shall have occasion to revert to this 
a little farther on. 

The Genesis writer had also observed the diversity 
of languages in the world, and ventured an explanation 
of this. Originally, he says, ‘the whole world was of 
one language and of one speech.* But when God saw 
that by the use of this single language man aspired ‘ to 
build a city and a tower whose top may reach unto 
heaven,’ He ‘confounded their language so that they 
might not understand one another’s speech,’ and ‘scat- 
tered them abroad from thence upon the face of the 
earth.’ The ‘city and tower’ was obviously used by 
the writer as a figure to symbolize the inordinate vanity 
of man’s knowledge and power, and since language was 
man’s prime instrument for the realization of his am- 
bitious aims, his vanity could be most effectively curbed 
by the confusion of his language. This whole explana- 
tory story is based upon a purely moral conception of 
the world, and was no doubt a very plausible explana- 
tion at a time when the man-inhabited world was con- 
ceived as a relatively small place, and man’s sojourn on 
it of relatively short duration. 

This Genesis account of the beginnings and diversity 
of language when looked at in a sensible way is really 
quite a natural one, though the na'ive statement that 
God brought the animals to Adam as one person might 
bring them to another, indicates a point of view quite 
different from the modem. was Adam, however* 
according to the narrative, who actually did the naming, 



TWO OLD-WORLD THEORIES OF LANGUAGE 


that is, who actually made the first words of language. 
In the process of time, however, theological precon- 
ception and prejudice gradually shifted the emphasis 
from Adam to God, and interpreted the story as mean- 
i ngth at language was a direct and ready-made gift from 
God to man. y 

From the modem point of view this theological ex- 
planation of language origin and vicissitudes has turned 
out to be unsatisfactory, but it is interesting as showing 
man’s very early interest in the problem and some of his 
first guesses about it. It is significant also from the fact 
that it was the generally accepted language origin theory 
up until the middle of the eighteenth century. 


2. Plato (427-347 B.c.) 

Plato’s theory of language origin requires mention 
here, though for valid reasons its exposition will be 
postponed to another place . The Hebrew writer of the 
Genesis narrative gave us merely a fact ual statemen t 
of language origin. While the facts which he noted 
are, as we saw, significant, he attempted no scientific 
or metaphysical exposition of them. Plato, on the 
other hand, accepts the facts of language as given, start- 
ing, as it were, where the Hebrew account leaves off, 
and then asks the question : * How did the facts of lan- 
guage come about?’ or more specifically: ‘ How were 
the first words of language actually made, ancf w hat wa s 
the principle wETcIToperatcd in and guided the process 

' *n ' ~ ~ 



CLEARING THE WAY 


of making?’ His approach to the question was entirely 
radical, and his treatment of it in the Cratylus &gt;t which, as 
usual with Plato, is a compound of science and philo- 
sophy, is on the whole more fundamental and adequate 
than any modem treatment of the subject that I know. 
Emerson once spoke of the ‘perpetual modernness’ of 
Plato’s dialogues. As with the other dialogues this 
perpetual modernness lifts the Cratylus q uite above the 
stream of historical treatises upon language origin which 
we are discussing in this section, and makes it contem- 
porary with the best modem discussions of the subject. 
Hence the examination of Plato’s theory will be post- 
poned until we come to the specific question of the 
actual beginnings of language which must be the subject 
of another volume. 

Plato, however, was aware of a prime difficulty in his 
quest of language origin in not having an adequate body 
of foreign language material for purpose of comparative 
study. Socrates, who leads the discussion, frequently 
comes across a word which is obviously not of Greek 
origin. These words, he says, must have been im- 
ported by the Greeks from their barbarian neighbours, 
and he makes in one place the significant remark, from 
the point of view of language study, that ‘ the barbarians 
are older than we are.’ He points out that to give a 
complete account of language origin these words of 
foreign source would have to be traced home to their 
original forms in the language of the people who made 
them, but the Greeks had no knowledge of the language 



TWO OLD-WORLD THEORIES OF LANGUAGE 


of their barbarian neighbours to enable them to carry 
out this investigation. Plato, with respect to this 
difficulty, was in the same position as were Herder and 
other early modem investigators of language prior to Sir 
William Jones’s discovery of Sanscrit in die seventeen- 



CHAPTER m 


ROUSSEAU (I7I2-7J): THE OLD AND THE NEW 

During the Middle Ages, and up to the middle of the 
eighteenth century, the theologians’ mutilated ver- 
sion of the Genesis account of language origin, the 
divine-origin theory as it came to be called, was the 
theory held by Christian Europe. In the eighteenth 
century, however, the question of the probability of a 
natural rather than a supernatural origin of language 
began to stir in men’s minds. Rousseau’s essay on the 
Origin of Languages, about 1750, might be taken as the 
historical landmark which stands between the old and 
new points of view. This essay is in itself disappointing 
to one who is acquainted with Rousseau’s other works. 
His mental interests were practical rather than specu- 
lative, and he had no real convictions about the question 
of language as he had about education, society, and 
government. He was interested in language, and the 
changes in language, in relation to the practical needs 
of the people in social and national groups, and in 
diverse climatic conditions, rather than in the origin of 
language itself as an instrument of human reason. As a 
consequence his essay on the Origin of Languages — not 
‘Language’ — is hardly more than a series of discon- 

» 4 ‘ 



ROUSSEAU: THE OLD AND THE NEW 


nected reflections upon various aspects of languages, 
including a discussion of the relation of language to 
melody and harmony in music which occupies about 
one-third of the essay. 

There is a curious inconsistency in the essay, which, 
in so far as Rousseau can be accepted as a representative 
of the current thought of the time, may mark histori- 
cally the last association of the theological and the philo- 
sophical conceptions of language in a single treatise, on 
the eve of the final parting of their ways. Rousseau 
admits, in at least a lukewarm fashion, the divine-origin 
theory of language: ‘Adam spake; very well: Adam 
had been taught by God Himself. ... It is easy to 
reconcile the authority of the Scripture with the monu- 
ments of antiquity, and one is not reduced to treating 
as fables traditions as old as the people who transmitted 
them to us.’ His own independent comments, how- 
ever, all point to a natural origin of language, though 
he did not develop them with sufficient philosophic 
acumen to be of much value to a modem student of 
language. The sentence by which he closes the essay 
might be taken quite literally as a fair judgment of the 
philosophical value of his work, and as showing also, in 
his quotation from M. Duclos, the source and nature 
of his own interest in language : ‘I j hall close these 
superficial reflections, but from which others more pro- 
found may arise, by a passage from M. Duclos, which 
suggested them to me: “It would be the subject of a 
very philosophical examination to show by examples 



CLEARING THE WAY 


Jhow much the character, the morals, and the interests 
of a people influence their language.” ’ Rousseau’s 
essay has interest for the modem student rather as a 
historical signpost than as a philosophical exposition. 
It stands, as I have said, between the old world and the 
new, and Iliave allowed a chapter to Rousseau’s name 
to mark symbolically his position between the two 
worlds.

CHAPTER IV 


HERDER AND THE NEW WORLD 

x. The New-World View 

In Being’s floods, in Action’s storm, 

I walk and work, above, beneath, 

Work and weave in endless motion! 

Birth and Death, 

An infinite ocean; 

A seizing and giving 
The fire of living. 

’Tis thus at the roaring Loom of Time I ply. 

And weave the living Robe G f Deity. 

Goethe, Song of the Earth- Spirit, Faust, 1774. 

If pressed for an exact date of the true beginning of the 
scientific investigation of language, one would naturally 
think of the date of the publication of Johann Gottfried 
Herder’s prize essay on the Origin of Language, 1772. 
In passing from Rousseau’s essay to Herder’s — although^ 
they are separated by only twenty-two years, and by thej 
distance between Paris and Strassburg — we step clearly 
over the threshold from medievalism into the new 
world of free philosophical investigation, into an atmo- 
sphere as clear as that in which Plato and Aristotle 
worked. Herder’s essay on language is the starting 



CLEARING THE WAY 


point for all the scientific work that has since been done 
on that subject, and has thus a very important historical 
significance in addition to its permanent scientific value. 
Its full significance, however, can be fully appreciated 
only in relation to the general scientific and philosophic 
thought of the time, and it will be necessary to digress 
for a few pages to describe the intellectual atmosphere 
in which Herder worked in the latter half of the 
eighteenth century in Germany. 

Professor Jespersen, in tracing the history of lin- 
guistic science in his recent book on the Language , its 
Nature, Development, and Origin, says that: ‘The chief 
innovation of the beginning of the nineteenth century 
was the historical point of view . . . the application of 
the notion of history to other things than wars and the 
vicissitudes of dynasties, and the discovery of the idea 
of development or evolution as pervading the whole 
universe.’ This statement is in the broad sense true. 
Yet it must be remembered that while the thorough- 
going application of the principle of evolution to the 
many phases of existence was the achievement of the 
nineteenth century, the discovery of the principle as a 
directing agency in the world,, together with its corollary 
or co-principle of the organic unity of the world, was 
really the discovery of the closing half of the eighteenth 
century. It was the central and stimulating idea in 
the scientific work of Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) 
in Britain, and of Buffon (1707-88) and Lamarck 
(1744-1829) in France; and in the philosophy, science,

and poetry of Kant (1724-1804), Herder (1744-1803), 
and Goethe (1749-1832) in Germany, to mention only 
the greatest names. The movement in Germany is our 
chief concern here. It was more comprehensive in 
scope than the movement in England and France, and 
had a greater influence upon the course of world 
thought in the nineteenth century ; and Herder himself, 
whose essay on language is our main interest, bore an 
active part in it. His essay on language, however, was 
only a special phase of the general evolutionary theory 
of the world which was being formulated in the thought 
of the time, and the comments upon the general scien- 
tific and philosophic work of Kant, Goethe, and Herder 
in the next few paragraphs are given merely with a view 
to a better understanding of Herder’s language essay. 


2. Kant (1724-1804) and Goethe (1749-1832) 

But here, as in so many other cases, Germany, learned, inde- 
fatigable, deep-thinking Germany, comes to our aid. — Carlyle, 
Sartor Resartus, 1830. 

1 

Kant was a mathematician and scientist before he 
became a philosopher, and these pre-philosophical 
studies played a large part in shaping his philosophy. 
In his first important scientific work, the General History 
of Nature and Theory of the Heavens, 1755, he explained 
the present animate world as the result of a very long 
and gradual evolution, through natural causation, from 

* 19 



CLEARING THE WAY 


the less to the more complex forms of life. To the 
general conception of evolution then gradually coming 
to view he contributed the original ideas of Selection, 
Adaptation, Environment, and Inheritance as essential 
factors in the general development. In his last signifi- 
cant philosophic work, The Critique of Judgment , 1790, 
which he designed and developed as the coping stone 
for his two former philosophical works, The Critique of 
Pure Reason , 1781, and The Critique of Practical Reason , 
1788, the conception of development is a dominating 
and shaping idea. Here, however, in his final views, 
he unites the law of natural causation with the teleo- 
logical principle of final causes acting towards definite 
ends. Haeckel, in his estimate of Kant’s work, con- 
siders this introduction of purpose into world-evolution 
as a retrograde step, on the part of Kant, from the views 
of natural causation developed in his History of Nature 
thirty-five years earlier. Kant, however, considered 
his final statement as the more comprehensive and 
logical, more in accordance with the entire phenomena 
of nature, life, and mind in the world. But the inter- 
esting part of the whole Critique of Judgment is the 
modernness of the conception of evolution developed 
in it. There is one paragraph in the book that might 
have been used by Darwin himself as a statement in 
outline of all that he afterwards worked out in detail in 
the Origin of Species (18^9) and Descent of Man (1871). 
This paragraph alone would give us perhaps better than 
anything else we could find a clear image of the ad- 



HERDER AND THE NEW WORLD 


vanced scientific and philosophic thought of the time 
in Germany. 

It is desirable [says Kant] to examine the great domain of 
organized beings, by means of comparative anatomy, in order to 
see whether we may not find in them something resembling a 
system, and indeed something in accordance with the principle 
of generation. Otherwise we would have to be content with a 
mere consideration of things as they are — which gives us no in- 
sight into their generation — and, in despair, give up all hope or 
claim of natural insight into this field. The agreement of so 
many genera of animals in a certain common plan of structure, 
which seems to be fundamental not only in the structure of their 
bones, but also in the arrangements of their other parts — so that 
with an admirable simplicity of original outline, a great variety 
of species has been produced by the shortening of one member 
and the lengthening of another, the involution of this part and 
the evolution of that — allows a ray of hope, however faint, to 
penetrate into our minds, that some results might be obtained 
here by the application of the principle of the mechanism of 
Nature, without which there can be no natural science at all. 
This analogy of forms, which with all their differences seem 
to have been produced according to a common original type, 
strengthens our surmise of an actual relationship among them in 
their procreation from a common parent, through the gradual 
approximation of one animal-genus to another — from that genus 
in which the principle of purposiveness seems best authenticated, 
namely man, down to the polyp, and again from this down to 
mosses and lichens, and finally to the lowest form of Nature ob^ 
servable to us, namely to raw matter. And so the whole technique 
of Nature, which, as perceived in organized beings, is so incom- 
prehensible to us that we feel ourselves compelled to think a 
different principle for it, seems to have been derived from matter 
and its powers according to mechanical laws (like those which 
are operative in the formation of crystal). — Kant, Critique of 
Judgment, Bernard’s translation, p. 337. 

* Ji 



CLEARING THE WAY 


This was published, as we have said, in 1790, and 
this view of the organic unity of the diversified forms 
of the world, and their natural evolution from simple 
beginnings, together with the principle of purpose 
which Kant associated with it, constitutes the logical 
groundwork of the Critique of Judgment. 

The same idea pervades the contemporary work of 
Goethe. ‘Goethe,’ says Professor Osborn, ‘was the 
greatest poet of Evolution ; he saw the law as a poet, as 
a philosopher, and as an anatomist.’ His scientific 
work is very well known in a general way to those who 
have read the story of modern scientific thought; but 
as a recent visitor to Weimar says: 

It is impossible to have an adequate conception of the part 
played by science in Goethe’s life unless one has visited the 
Goethe house in Weimar. The place resembles a museum 
rather than a private home, and several large rooms of this 
museum contain nothing but the apparatus and materials which 
Goethe used in his scientific experimentation. Chemicals, rocks, 
and ores of all kinds, and many species of intricate instruments 
occupy table after table. But most surprising of all is Goethe’s 
private library. One would expect to find there a rich collec- 
tion of belles lettres ; instead one finds the shelves lined with 
journals of chemistry, physics, geology, etc. It is only after 
such a visit that one appreciates the many-sided thoroughness of 
that great mind. — Steinhauer. 

Goethe was a lifelong student of science, and during 
his first Weimar period from 1775 to 1786 his interest 
was devoted almost exclusively to scientific study: 
-mineralogy, botany, geology, physiology, osteology. 

22“ 



HERDER AND THE NEW WORLD 


He went to Jena for a course in anatomy under Loder, 
and to perfect his own knowledge he gave weekly 
lectures on the skeleton to the young men there. His 
absorption in science caused great concern to Herder } 
and others of his friends in Weimar who already knew j 
his genius for poetry. But all these systematic studies 
over a dozen years were carried on from a purely 
scientific curiosity to know how the present world came 
to be what it is, and the idea of evolution gave him the 
answer to the question. His research in natural science 
alone would have given him a place in modem thought 
had it not been overshadowed by his greater work in 
poetry. 

He went to Italy in 1786, and it was during his two 
years’ stay there that his main interest was turned back 
again from science to poetry. ‘I have abandoned,’ he 
writes from Italy, ‘my master Loder for my friend 
Schiller, and Linnaeus for Shakespeare.’ He saw per- 
haps, as Shakespeare did, that the poet in his creative 
activity ‘shares with great creating nature,’ and in his 
art, as nature’s agent, may add another rung to the 
ladder of evolution itself, while science at best can only 
examine and tabulate the rungs that are already set; and 
if, in his return to poetry, ‘science lost a disciple who 
would have ranked among the very highest, if not the 
highest,’ 1 the world, in compensation, has gained an 
edifice of art whose foundations are laid in the excava- 
tions of scientific research and whose upper structure 

1 Osborn, From the Greek to Darwin, p. i S i . 

' 23 



CLEARING THE WAY 


will itself be the object of many scientific investigations 
in the future. Poetry deals primarily with human life; 
and with nature only as it affects the growth and course 
of human life. Even in his scientific years Goethe 
believed that ‘the chief study of Mankind is Man,’ but 
he saw that the roots of man’s life are in nature, and 
his scientific research had a purpose in relation to his 
poetry. It gave a proportioned perspective to his view 
of life and the world as a whole, and gave depth and 
unity of design to his representations of life in both his 
verse and prose. If, as Schiller says of him, ‘his spirit 
works and seeks in every direction, striving to create a 
whole,' his scientific studies contributed not a little to 
that unifying impulse and vision. His work, as Carlyle 
pointed out, is significantly original and modem, the 
intellectual faculty as clear as die imaginative faculty 
is vivid. Everywhere in the world he saw development 
and evolution, not mechanical, but organic and vital. 
The song of the Earth-Spirit in Faust, quoted above, con- 
sidered as a vital expression of the principle of develop- 
ment at work in the world, has not been surpassed by 
anything of a similar kind and length in fche nineteenth 
century. It is the core of his interpretation of life 
and the world.

HERDER AND THE NEW WORLD 


3. Herder (1744-1803) 

j By his work on language, Ober den Ursptung der Sprache (1772), 

; Herder may be said to have laid the first rude foundations of the 
science of comparative philology, and of that deeper science of 
the ultimate nature and origin of language. — J. Sully (1911). 

&lt; 

It was in this atmosphere that Herder lived. He was 
a student under Kant — who was twenty years his senior 
— at Konigsberg between 1762 and 1764, and Kant’s 
History of Nature had been published seven years before. 
He met and became an intimate friend of Goethe — who 
was five years his junior — at Strassburg in 1770, and 
from 1776 when Herder, through the influence of 
Goethe, moved to Weimar, the two men lived in more 
or less intimate contact with one another there until 
Herder’s death in 1803. With the greatest scientist- j 
philosopher on one side and scientist-poet on the other, 
and with his own native genius for science, literature, 
and philosophy, all working under the impulse of a 
new idea that promised to give unity to the whole 
world of nature and man, Herder’s own contributions 
to the general movement had every likelihood of being 
important and unique. He absorbed Kant’s ideas of 
evolution in nature, and in his own work, Ideas for a 
Philosophy of the History of Mankind ( 1784-9 1 ), he carried 
them forward in several important directions, notably 
by his development of the doctrine of the Unity of 
Type pervading the entire animal world. The clear- 
ness of his grasp of the general principle of evolution, 

4 



CLEARING THE WAY 


and the significance of his own contributions to it may 
be estimated by the fact that when F. von Barenach 
published his exposition of Herder’s works in 1877 he 
gave it the title, Herder as the Precursor of Darwin and 
Modern Natural Philosophy. From all this one can esti- 
mate Herder’s general equipment for the investigation 
of language origin and development as a particular phase 
of genesis and evolution; and since, as we have said, his 
essay is the starting point of modem language study, it 
seemed worth while giving this space to a description 
of the intellectual atmosphere out of which it came. 

His essay on language was stimulated chiefly by 
Johann Peter Sussmilch’s treatise on language in 1766, 
which was written with the purpose of proving the 
orthodox view which was held generally up to that time, 
that ‘human language is a direct gift from God.’ Her- 
der’s primary object was to refute this thesis by sub- 
mitting evidence and argument to show that language 
was invented and gradually perfected by man as the 
natural means of developing his own reason. He starts 
with a statement from Siissmilch which Siissmilch 
claimed to have proved in his treatise, namely, that ‘thej 
use of language .is indispensable for the use of reason, ’ 
and he uses, this statement as a basis for refuting Siiss- 
milch’s whole theory. He pointed out that when man, 
in the very first step of his reasoning power, had isolated 
one object of his environment from all other objects, 
this isolated object ‘retained in the mind, was a word 
in the soul. . . . With this first distinct concept of 

16 - 



HERDER AND THE NEW WORLD 

an object isolated from other objects, language was 
already in his soul, hence it was invented through his 
own resources and not in a mechanical manner through 
divine instructions. It was not God who invented 
language for man. Man himself had to invent language 
in exercising his own powers.’ 

One of Herder’s strong negative arguments against 
the divine origin of language was based upon ‘the im- 
perfection of language.’ The" fact, for example, that 
the Arab languages' had a great many Synonyms for 
common -and familiar things — ‘fifty different names for 
the lion, two hundred for the snake, eighty for honey, 
seventy for a stone’ — and was often lacking altogether 
in words for the expression of * difficult and rare ideas, ’ 
shows that language was made by man in his own im- 
perfect groping fashion, and not by God. This line of 
argument is interesting to the modern student as a 
record of the contemporary attitude of mind that had 
to be broken down before men could get forward in 
the natural investigation of language. 

Herder’s essay will always remain an important docu- 
ment in the history of linguistic science fortwo Reasons . 
First, for the preliminary clearing of the way which we 
have just mentioned above. He did effectively refute, 
once for all, the divine-origin theory of language, and 
make the way clear and open for the free scientific in- 
vestigation of language which has gone on since the 
publication of his essay one hundred and sixty-five years 
ago. This was a very necessary piece of work at the 



CLEARING THE WAY 


time, even though it has little more than a historical 
interest for us now. 

Second. Herder’s real interest, however, was not in 
this negative work of refuting an inadequate theory, 
but in replacing it by a sound philosophical theory of 
his own. ‘If,’ says he, ‘it is incomprehensible to others 
how a human mind could invent language, it is incom- 
prehensible to me how a human mind could be what it 
is without discovering language for itself.’ This is his 
starting point, and his long and closely written essay of 
some ninety-odd pages is so rich in evidence and sug- 
gestion regarding the natural origin and development of 
language that no serious modem student of language 
can afford to be unacquainted with it. 

But, as already pointed out, for the successful in- 
vestigation of the problem of language one requires an 
adequate body of concrete language data as well as a 
directing principle, and that body of fact was not avail- 
able in 1772. Herder, who knew the contemporary 
data well, says in his essay that the language material 
of the various foreign peoples is as yet so meagre and 
unreliable that ‘an exact science of comparative lan- 
guage is not yet possible,’ so that despite his own great 
natural endowment he was in the position of a bird 
attempting a flight with one of its wings as yet inade- 
quately feathered.

CHAPTER V 


FROM HERDER TO DARWIN, 1772-1871 

The Discovery of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology 

Nature leads the way. Man emerges on the scene, follows 
her footprints, marks and registers them in language, and makes 
a Science of Nature. Then he looks back and discovers that Lan- 
guage, while following the path of Nature, has left a trail of her 
own. He returns on this new trail, again marks and registers its 
footprints, and makes a Science of Language. 

My purpose in this book is not to compare languages as 
in linguistic science, or to trace their concrete develop- 
ment as in language history ; but to describe the problem 
which gave birth to language, to show the place of lan- 
guage in the general scheme of world evolution, and to 
point out its basic structure in relation to the two forms 
of sense, Space and Time. I have dealt at some length 
with Herder Y»nd his time because that per i od was the 
beginning of the modem movement in la nguage in- 
vestigation In which we are still engaged. For the 
nextTiundred ► years , from Herder’s essay in 1772 to 
DarvdtLsMescoiyf'Jli'an in 1871, I can only touch some 
of the peaks in the development of linguistic, theory 
and science, that, in their combined results, have pre- 
pared the way for the present inquiry, and that may 

2* 



CLEARING THE WAY 


help to give the perspective necessary to set the fabric 
of language clearly in its place among the other phe- 
nomena of the world. If this mode of treatment should 
appear to the language specialist as in some degree 
wanting in the ‘hard factualness ’ of language, the ex- 
planation is that the inclusion of such factual material 
would not contribute to the investigation in hand. If 
one can make clear the world-problem which called 
language into existence, and show the structure which 
language was destined to assume in order to answer this 
problem, then the way should be better prepared and 
the impulse quickened for tracing man’s first steps 
and subsequent windings in the actual making of 
language. 

Herder, as we saw, had a clear grasp of the general 
principle of evolution, but was handicapped in his appli- 
cation of the principle to language because of the lack' 
of an adequate and trustworthy body of foreign language 
material in 1772. At the close of the century, how- 
ever, while Herder was still living, that required 
I material came to hand in a rather unexpected but quite 
\natural way. •» 

The struggle between the French and English in the 
eighteenth century for the possession of the territory 
and wealth of India brought a number of French and 
English scholars, who were connected with the military 
or civil occupation of India, into contact with the San- 
skrit language. A French Jesuit missionary, Courdoux, 

^ sent a memoir to the French Institute in 1767, calling 



FROM HERDER TO DARWIN 


attention to numerous similarities between Sanskrit and 
Latin words, and also to certain similarities between 
the respective inflections of these words. His obser- 
vations were not published, however, until forty years 
later, and meanwhile similar observations were made 
and announced by others. 

The sch olar whose name stands first among the intro- 
ducers of Sanskrit and comparative. linguistics into 
Europe is Sir William Jones (1746-94). He had 
shown a genius for languag e while a student at Harrow 
and Oxford, and at twenty-four had . a mastery of ten 
foreign language s, including Hebrew, Arabic, and Per- 
sian. Though an accomplished classical scholar he had 
a preference for oriental languages. He took up law 
as a means of live lihood, was called to the bar in 1774, 
and in 1783 was appointed-ajudge of the Supreme Court 
of Calcutta., This gave him the opportunity he had 
EeerTawaiting for the study of the Sanskrit language at 
first hand. In 1784, the year after his arrival in Cal-| 
cutta, with the co-operation of Sir Charles Wilkins 
(1749-1836), ‘the first Englishman who acquired a 
critical knowledge of the Sanskrit language . . . and 
opened the mine of Sanskrit literature’ (Sir W. Jones), 
he founded the Asiatic Society for the study of the lan- 
guage and literature of the East. This was an important 
event. ‘The history of what may be called European 
Sanskrit philology,’ says Max-Muller, ‘dates from the 
foundation of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta in 1784.’ 
It was his third address before this society, on 27th 



CLEARING THE WAY 


September 1786, 1 On the Hindus , that Sir William Jones 
gave the memorable paragraph that became the starting 
point for the modem science of Comparative Philology 
in Europe. 

The Sanskrit language [says he], whatever be its antiquity, is 
of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the G reek, more 
copious than the Latin , and more exquisitely refined than either ; 
yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots 
of verbs, and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have 
been produced by accident ; so strong indeed that no philologer 
could examine them all three without believing them to have 
sprung from some common source, which perhaps no longer exists. 
There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for sup- 
1 posing that both the Gothick and the Celtick, though blended with 
la very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanskrit; 
land the old Persian might be added to the same family. 2 

Sir William Jones did not live to carry out in detail 
the comparison which he here makes, but in this single 
paragraph he clearly formulated the conception which 
became the basis for the whole science of comparative 
linguistics, which was subsequently developed in Europe 
during the first three-quarters of the nineteenth century. 

In 1808 Friedrich Schlegel (1772-1829) published hid 
book on The Language and Wisdom of the Indians, in which] 
he carried out in detail the comparison between San-| 
skrit and the European languages suggested by Jones iqj 
his address of 1786. By tracing the similarities in 

1 Professor O. Jesperson in Language, Its Nature, Development, and Origin, 
1925 (p. 3}), gives this date as 1796, a mistake of ten years, due probably 
to a printer’s error.

vocabulary and grammatical structure, he established 
beyond any doubt the family relationship between San- 
skrit an d the better-known languages of Europ_e, chiefly 
Greek, Latin, and German. He is the first, so far as I 
know, to use the phrase ‘comparative grammar.’ 

Rasmus Rask (1787-1832), the Danish scholar, by 
his genius for linguistic studies, by his comprehensive 
first-hand knowle dge of many languages obtained by ex- 
tensive_travels, from Sweden to India (1816-23), and 
Tjy his method of painstaking comparison Mid classifi- 
cation of la nguages on the basis of grammatical struc- 
ture, and of similarity and difference in the most 
essential and indispensable words, became in a very 
t rue sense the actual found er of the mo den T sc ience of 
language, 

' Jakob Grimm (1785-1863) — with the co-operation 
of his brother Wilhelm (1786-1859) — was first led to 
the investigation of language through his study of old 
German* popular poetry and folklore. Starting with 
Rask’s observation of certain regular ‘consonant shifts 
m the transition of certain groups of words from G reek 
and Latin irm/ the Germanic languages, he formulated 
wKatiiThbw known as f Grimm’s Law, ’ whi c h revealed 
certain hitherto unnoticed consonant re lation s between 
well-known words i n these two groups of language s, 
and in this way gave a new fascination and impulse to 
the science of comparative philolog y, which has con- 
tinued from the publication of Grimm’s comparatiye 
German Grammar in 1822 down to the present time. He 



CLEARING THE WAY 


was also the first philologis t to separate language from, 
literature, and to raise all languages, and even dialects, 
to a common level of dignity for purposes of scientific 
study, independent of the value of the literature which 
they might or might not possess. 

Franz Bopp (1791—1867). the next significant con- 
tributor to linguistic science, receive d his first impulse 
towards com parative la nguage study fro m Sch legel!s 
JiooJc referred to above, on The Language an d Wisdom of 
the Indians . which was published , as we have noticed, in 
1808 while Bopp was still a student of seventeen at the 
Lyceum in Bavaria. In 1812 he went to Paris at the 
expense of the Bavarian Government to study Sanskrit, 
After four years’ study there he pu blished in 1816 — 
when he was twenty-five — his first and most important 

( book, On the Conjugation System of the Sanskrit Language 
in Comparison with Greek , Latin, Persian, and German. 
Schlegel and his followers had already established the 
family relationship among these languages. Bopp was 
inspired with the hope that by a complete analytic 
comparison of the grammars of these related languages 
he could discover their oldest recorded* shapes, and by 
this route might be able to discover the ultimate origin 
of grammatical forms. The preliminary work of com- 
parison was so well done that while he failed in hi s 
quest for the ultimate origin of language, he founded th e 
scie nce of Comparative Grammar — ‘ a peu prfes comme 
Christophe Colomb a d 4 couvert l’Amerique en cher- 
chant- la route des Indes ’ (Meillet). In recognition of 


FROM HERDER TO DARWIN 


this fact, the Bopp Foundation, for the promotion of the 
study of Sanskrit and Comparative Grammar, was estab- 
lished at Berlin in 1866, the fiftieth anniversary of the 
publication of his book, by contributions from scholars 
in all parts of the world. Bopp was appointed pro- 
fessor of Sanskrit and Comparative Grammar at Berlin 
in 1822, and continued writing and publishing there on 
comparative languages until his death in 1867. 

Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-183^) was not so 
much a philologist as a philosopher who chose language 
as the chief object of his philosophical investigations. 
He developed the theory that the structure of each 
separate language grew out of and reflected the peculiar 
mental life of the people who made it, and that each 
language had therefore its own individuality which 
separated it from all other languages. The essay in 
which he presented this view, The Heterogeneity of Lan- 
guage and its Influence upon the Intellectual Development oj 
Mankind — published in 1836, the year after his death — 
has often been called 1 the text-book of the philosophy of 
speech .’ a tribute to the force with which he developed 
his thesis, insistence upon essential differences 

between languages is pertinent here, since the object 
of the present treatise is to establish the opposite point 
of view, namely, first, the identity of the problem 
which originally called language into existence in all 
parts of the world, and, second, the consequent identity 
of the basic structure of all languages in meeting this 
problem, despite the individual differences that have 



CLEARING THE WAY 


entered into the various languages made by various races 
of people. 

The names given above mark sufficiently for our pur- 
pose the steps in the development of language science 
and theory from Herder to the middle of the nineteenth 
century. Two more names must be added to bring us 
from that point to the eighteen-seventies when Darwin 
entered the field. 

Max Muller (1823-1900), the German-English p hi- 
lologis t and philosopher, and William Dwight Whitne y 
(1827-94), the A merican philologist, came at a tim e 
— they did the important part of their language work 
between 1850 and 1873- — when the young science of 
j language had already made sufficient progress to claim 
1 a place of respect among the other modem sciences. 
Their work consisted mainly in gathering together, 
sifting, and unifying into some kind of single view, the 
best of the work that had been done in the preceding 
seventy-odd years. Both of them had, though in quite 
different ways, ‘the gift of expression/ which enabled 
them to present their views in a style which was scien- 
tifically adequate and at the same time 'popular, and 
which r endered a high s ervice t o the sc ience o f languag e 
by bringin g, it. out of the enclosed field of specialists 
and making i t un derstandable and attractive to the 
general reader who had an interest in human history 
and development. In this respect they did for lin- 
guistics, t hough in a lesser way, what Da rwin in the 
corresponding years did for biology. 

3 «"' 




FROM HERDER TO DARWIN 


Max Miill ej was bom and educated in Germany. 
After graduating from Leipzig he went to Berlin Uni- 
versity,- where he learned comparative philology from 
B opp, a nd philosophy from Schelling. He came to 
Oxford in 18^0, and lived, lectured, and wrote there 
until his death in 1900. His chief strength as a philo- 
logist was his imagi native i nsigh t. ~ He saw the living - 
significance of words, which gave him a clue to their 
relations and life-history, and guided him in selecting 
and arranging them into a system. In this way he did 
much towards transforming the growing mass of lan- 
guage material from a mere burden of the memory to 
a significant structure of the reason, whose various 
parts suggested and sustained each other easily in the 
mind; and incidentally he raised the status of his reader 
from hod-carrier to architect, whose interest was not 
merely in carrying loads of word-material at a master’s 
bidding, but in the actual reconstruction of the word- 
edifice which told the story of human progress. His 
aim in philology wa s simila r to Darwin’s i n biology , 
but the field was more subtle and recondite, much of the 
necessary factual material wasTost or obscured by time, 
and more pertinent still, Muller had not the same com- 
prehensive synthetic grasp of the whole field as Darwin 
had, so that his work had nothing like the rounded 
completeness of Darwin’s, which renders it capable of 
being easily held and visualized in a single view. 

Muller’s gift of style, of figure, and rhetoric, which 
was very similar to Huxley’s in science, gave imaginative 

*37 



CLEARING 1HF WAY 


concreteness his work, frequently raising his science 
into literature. But his strength here was at times 
his weakness. Fascinated by the symmetry , of the 
structure he was building, he had a tendency to strain 
or modify the fact so as to make it fit more neatly its 
particular niche in the system. His impulse towards 
rhetoric often led him also into colourful and telling 
forms of expression where the subject required quiet- 
ness and precision. 

Another impulse also tended to lead Max Muller 
astray in his theory of language. He seemed to be 
obsessed with the desire to win for linguistics a place 
of respect and dignity equal to that already accorded 
the older and better - established natural sciences. 
Hence in the opening chapter of his first important 
book. The Science of Language (1861), he writes: ‘I 
always took it for granted that the science of 
languag e, which is best known in this'Tounfry by ihe 
name of comparative philology, is one of the physical 
sciences, and that therefore its method ought to be the 
same as that which has been followed with so much 
success in botany, geology, anatomy, and other branches 
of the study of nature. ’ This, physical-science bias led 
him_to his peculiar cause-and-effect theory of thg_origin 
of language. In nature, he says, every object when 
struck by a solid body responds with its own peculiar 
sound. Hence the four-hundred-odd original roots of 
language, which the philologists at that time thought 
they had discovered, were, according to Muller’s 

38 / 



FROM HERDER TO DARWIN 


physical theory, the original ‘phonetic types or typical 
sounds’ which man’s mind gave off in response to the 
various impacts which the world made upon it . 1 ‘ What 
is antecedent to the production of these roots is the 
work of nature ; what follows after is the work of man. ’ a 
Just how or why the first part of the history of language 
should be considered as the work of nature and the 
second part as the work of man is not very clear. For- 
tunately he did not consistently hold to his physical- 
science theory of language. Most of his work, and by 
far the most valuable part of it, is concerned with lan- 
guage development as a non-physical phenomenon. 

He had an ext ensive and, in most cases, an ex ac t know- 
ledge of words and langua ges, and one is constantly 
surprised at the many vital suggestions which are found 
in his works. He popu larized the science enormously 
and stirred his studentTto an enthusiasm corresponding 
to his own. One cannot read his books without being 

1 It may be interesting to notice that Mr. J. B. Watson’s most recent 
exposition of language (Behaviorism, revised edition, 1930, Chap. X), apart 
from its new behaviourist diction and phraseology, is a logical development 
of Max Muller's theory here. All human behaviour of action, thought, 
and speech is expjjjnsd by Mr. Watson as phases of the simple formula of 
‘stimulus and rosponse.' 'The behaviourist,’ he says, ‘advances a natural 
theory about thinking which makes it just as simple, and just as much a part 
of biological processes, as tennis playing’ (p. 238). Speech is thinking 
‘aloud in words’ (p. 246), and ‘speaking overtly or to ourselves (thinking) 
is just as objective a type of behaviour as baseball’ (p. 6). Thought and 
language are both explained as the materials of an objective natural science. 
After a careful reading, however, of Mr. Watson’s interesting exposition 
of thought and language by reducing them to simple phases of ‘stimulus and 
response,’ one has the uneasy feeling that he is being induced, to borrow an 
apt phrase from the late Professor J. S. Haldane, 'to take a gigantic leap in 
the dark.’

curiously stimulated by them, even if the stimulus is 
often, as it was to his American contemporary philolo- 
gist, Whitney, one of antipathy; and like some of 
Ruskin’s art criticisms, by his genius for making dead 
things li’ e, his errors are often more valuable to the 
reader than the true findings of pedantic scholars. 

Max Muller's contemporary and co-worker in the 
task of giving a unified view of linguistic science as it 
stood in the third quarter of the nineteenth century 
was the American philologist, W. D. Whitney. 
Curiously enough, both scholars were trained under 
i the same teacher. After two years’ study of Sanskrit 
at Yale University, Whitney went to Berlin — in the 
same year, 1 8^o, in which Muller left Berlin for Oxford 
— to take a three years’ course in Sanskrit under Bopp. 
On his return to America in 18^4 he was appointed 
professor of Sanskrit at Yale, where he lived and worked 
until his death in 1894, the hundredth anniversary of 
the death of Sir William Jones, ‘the founder of Indo- 
European philology.’ Incidentally Whitney was the 
winner of the first Bopp prize awarded by the Berlin 
Academy of Science in 1870 ‘for the jnqgt important 
I contribution to Sanskrit philology during thfe preceding 
' three y^ars.’ 

| The two books in which Whitney gave his sum- 
/marized view of linguistic science, with significant con- 
i' tributions of his own, Language and the Study of Language 
j (1867) and The Life and Growth &lt;f Language (1875), 
were translated into several languages, and were hardly 



FROM HERDER TO DARWIN 


less popular than those of his co-worker and antagonist^ 
in the field, Max Muller. The se cond book covers 
with some important modifications the same ground as 
the first, and the fact that it was designed to give , as 
the author says, ‘a n outl i ne of linguistic scienc e, ’ based 
upon ‘the n ow general ly accepted facts of language,’ 
and fhat it was written at the request of the publishers * 
of the International Scientific Series (it appeared as 
vol. xvi of the series) , indicates that the young science 
of language had won its place among the older sciences I 
Though nominally an ‘outline’ of the science of lan- 
guage up to that time, the book when finished, by the 
clear organization of the already available material and 
theories, and by its numerous original and fruitful sug- 
gestions, proved itself to be a distinct contribution to 
the new science. His discussion of ‘ The Nature and 
Origin of Language ’ (Chap. XIV) is as valuable and valid 
as anything written before or since, and is still, on the 
whole, perhaps the best single chapter available on that 
subject. His differentiation between human language 
and the cries of animals is unusually precise and clear, 
and is in mop* points convincing still, despite the bias 
which Darwin and his disciples have given (o the 
thinking on that question. » 

The preceding paragraphs bring us t o the close of the 
third quarter of the nine teent h_ cen tury, a hundred 
years from Herder’s essay. During this period the 
question of the beginnings and development of lan- 
guage, while discussed in a purely scientific and 



CLEARING THE WAY 


philosophical manner, was confined to the human 
species alone, in the belief that the capacity for language 
was unique in man, and separated him from the animal 
world beneath him. Max Muller and Whitney, the 
chief representatives of the linguistic thought of the 
time, both clearly stated the position, and a sentence 
from each will give the definite starting point for the 
next stage of our advance. ‘ What, th en.* Muller 
asks, ‘is the difference betwe en brute and man? What 
is it that man can do, and of which we find no signs, no 
rudiments, in the whole brute world? I answer with- 
out hesitation: the one gr eat barrie r between the_ brute 
and man is Language’ ( Science of Language, Collectec 
Works , vol. ii, p. 489). ‘ But, as things are , 
\Whitney writes, ‘every community of men has a 
1 :ommon language^ while none of the lower animals are 
] tossessed of such ; their means of communication being 
' &gt;f so different a character that it has no right to be called 
&gt;y the same name’ ( Life and Growth of Language, 
Chap. XIV, p. 281, 187s)- 1 These two quotations 
give quite adequately the view , regarding man and 
language, which was held by lingui-tic scientists 
from 1772, when He r der fi rst clearly formulated it in 
His essa y, until Darwin entered the field in 1871. 

1 One may be excused for calling attention here to a characteristic differ- 
ence in these two sentences. The dogmatic certainty and emphatic pointed- 
ness of Muller’s statement, and the unemphatic, careful, measured quietness 
of Whitney's are like differentiating portraits of the two minds and their

CHAPTER VI 


DARWIN 

In this year falls the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Charles 
Darwin — one of those rare individuals who have altered the main 
trend of thought and inaugurated a new attitude and a new out- 
look in human affairs. — Julian Huxley, Contemporary Renew, 
October 1932. 


1. Darwir&amp;s Expansion of the Problem 

Language has justly been considered as one of the chief distinc- 
tions between man and the lower animals. But man, as a highly 
competent judge, Archbishop Whately, remarks, ‘is not the only 
animal that can make use of language to express what is passing 
in his mind, and can understand, more or less, what is so ex- 
pressed by another.’ — Darwin, Descent oj Man, Chap. IU. 

The investigation of language, as pointed out in the last 
chapter, had been carried on for a hundred years in the 
belief that lyguage was a uniqu e characteristic of m an, 
and did not extend to the animal world beneath him. 
But with the publication of the Descent o£ Ma n in 187 1 
the whole problem of language was suddenly expanded 
into a muc k wi der region . Darwin, in that book, dis- 
tinctly challenged the human boundaries that had been 
set to language as being artificial and arbitrary, and 
extended the problem over into the animal world, 

h 



CLEARING THE WAY 


/ maintaining that the difference between the language of 
* man and the cries of animals was not a difference in 


kind, as had been formerly thought, but a difference in 
degree only, a difference in definiteness of connotation 
and distinctness of articulation. This difference in 
language followed naturally, he maintained, upon the 
difference in degree of their mental development. 

I Max Muller, with other philologists, opposed Dar- 
win’s view, claiming that articulate language was the 
/evidence of man’s ‘power of abstraction,’ a power 
Which differentiated him completely from the animals. 
Darwin and his scientific colleagues replied that animals 
had also this power of abstraction, and produced a con- 
siderable body of evidence from the mental habits of 
animals (Chaps. Ill and IV in the Descent of Man), 
which was at least plausible enough to win the majority 
of votes from the semi-scientific reading public before 
whom the debate was carried on. 

Meantime neither party gave any exact definition of 
the word abstraction, upon which the controversy 
turned; nor did either party give any sufficiently 
accurate definition of the articulate language of man that 
would enable them to come to a precise answer as to 
whether it was the same as or different from the so- 
called language of the animals. And so, as often 
happens in heated debate, the meanings of the two 
si gnificant w ords, abstraction and articul ate language, 
which occupied the centre of the controversy, remained 
themselves involved in a mist, which prevented any 



DARWIN 


kind of precise comparison between the language of 
man and the cries of animals. 

Before the end of the nineteenth century, however, 
the Darwinian theory of evolution in general, together 
with the subsidiary theory of the identification of man 
and the lower animals with respect to both their intel- 
ligence and their language, had so completely won its 
way, both with the scientists themselves and with the 
general reading public, that the other side of the argu- 
ment had sunk almost entirely out of view. It has 
hardly shown its head since. It is customary now and 
a mark of modernism to speak of the language of animals 
and the language of man as merely two branches of the 
same thing, as though there were no longer any doubt 
about the question. One purpose of the present treat- 
ment is to open the question again and to re-examine 
more closely the difference between man and the 
animals which Darwin practically obliterated some 


sixty-six years ago ; t o discover if possible what specifi -i 
cally happened when man emerged from animal nature 


into a new world, whose new conditions necessitated 
articulate la^uage. What were the limits of the animal 
world from which he emerged whose needs were 
answered by a few natural cries ; what were the new 
horizons, new needs, new potentialities opened to him 
in his new world whose actualization urged him to the 
making of language ? 



CLEARING THE WAY 


2. Darwin’s Contribution to the Investigation 

On her great venture, Man, 

Earth gazes while her fingers dint the breast 
Which is his well of strength, his home of rest, 

And fair to scan. g eorge Meredith, Earth and Man. 


Before undertaking a criticism of Darwin’s arguments 
with a view to answering the questions raised at the 
close of the preceding chapter, one should say a word 
or two upon the positive contribution which Darwin 
has made to the whole question. He advanced the 
i nvestiga tion of the problem of l anguage definitely, as 
it seems to me, injbree.ways.- — - 

First. Previous to the appearance of Darwin’s book 
it had always been assumed that the problem of lan- 
guage was confined to the life of man; that it was a 
product of man’s reason, and that man’s reason marked 
him off distinctly from the rest of the world. Darwin 
jdistinctly challenged this view, maintaining that man is 
/ not separated from the animal world, either by his in- 
I telligence or his language, except in degree of develop- 
ment. He presented this new view with .such force, 
and supported it with so much concrete evidence, that 
th e old view of man’s uni que p osition -in the worl d 
could never a g a in be merely assumed - or taken for 
granted. If man does occupy a unique position, that 
position must now be desqribed and made explicitly 
clear. So that whether Darwin was right or wrong he 
unequivocally raised the problem into view, so as to 



DARWIN 


give a very definite starting point for any new advance 
in the steps towards its solution. 

. Second. Darwin brought together so large a body of 
facts, and pointed out so many characteristics of animal 
life which rises in ascending steps toward the life of 
man , that we have now a very completely detailed 
picture of the whole background of nature out of which 
the life of man emerges ; so that if man has actually risen 
to, and does actually hold, a unique and solitary position 
in the known world, the background of animal nature 
beneath him is now so fully elaborated that man’s 
characteristic portrait may be distinctly drawn in 
comparison and contrast with it. 

Third. Darwin’s work has brought home to our 
minds in a most distinct way the view that man is a! 
natural and integral part of the world, and not a mere' 
ye ^ojtj o- or foreigner, or temporary sojoumer/placed by 
deliberate external design upon the surface of an alien 
world of mechanical forces which are externally ma- 
nipulated in his exclusive interests. That is his third 
contribution to our better understanding of the world. 

On this laji point, however, it is worth while noting 
that not very many modem scientists or modem readers 
and writers in general have come to a full realization of 
what Darwin has done in this last respect. Darwin 
himself seems never to have absorbed this idea of the 
organic unity of the world from matter to man so 
completely into his mind as to fix it there as a per- 
manent and native element in his instinctive thought 



CLEARING THE WAY 


and speech. To the end, at least when off his guard, 
he continued to speak of man and the world as two 
separate though related things rather than as two phases 
of the one thing. This was, no doubt, due, in part at 
least, to the rigidity of language and its consequent 
limitations for the immediate expression of a new idea. 
But it was due also to the difficulty of assimilating and 
domesticating a new and radical idea within the mind 
so that it will function unconsciously there in adjusting 
one’s instinctive thought and speech to the new view . 1 

Most modem scientists continue to speak of the 
material world of mechanical forces as the real and per- 
manent world, and of man with all his mental faculties 
and moral purposes as an extrinsic chance-comer and 
would-be usurper, that by some kind of ‘biological 
accident,’ as Mr. Santayana puts it, has got upon the 
surface of a physical world of mechanical forces that 
have no intrinsic connection with the higher part of 
his own life, his mental and moral aims. This pseudo- 
scientific view appears in various ways in much of the 
representative poetry and fiction of the last seventy-five 
years, as well as in science and philosbphy. Matthew 
Arnold’s statement of man’s relation to the world he 
lives in in Empedocles: 

No, we are strangers here; the world is from of old, 
or 

To tunes we did not call our being must keep chime, 

1 Since making the first draft of this paragraph I have been struck by Mr. 
Bernard Shaw's determined statement of the unity or identity of man and 
the world in Man and Superman, Act in, p, 13). 



DARWIN 


are typical examples of it; and Arnold, like some of the 
materialistic scientists for whom he speaks, takes some 
pride in thus facing ‘unpalatable facts,’ and stating them 
frankly. In Thomas Hardy’s representation of life and 
the world in his greatest novels, as The Return of the 
Native or Tess of the d’ Urbervilles, and in many of his 
metaphysical poems, the determining agencies of the 
world, mechanical for the most part, and always blind 
and powerful, are conceived as not merely indifferent 
to man’s destiny, but often as in an actually sinister 
relation to it. 

This dualism between man’s higher destiny and the 
world out of which he emerged is not in consonance 
with the aim and tenor of Darwin’s work, even though 
Darwin himself did not, as I think, succeed in develop- 
ing his view into a concrete logical philosophy. He 
did believe in the organic unity of the world from 
matter to man, and in his books, especially the Origin 
and the Descent, he has amassed and organized such a 
body of evidence upon the resemblances between man 
and the animals with respect both to their physical and 
mental qualities* and between the animals and the lower 
forms of life, that we can hardly ever again think of man 
as separate from the world. The whole world now 
appears to us as a single world ; and if this view is right, 
then man with his complex physiological structure, 
and all his mental faculties and moral purposes as well, 
has in some way or other come out of this same world, 

and has risen by gradual steps, many of which still lie 

•

CLEARING THE WAY 


hidden, into the position where he now stands. Dar- 
win, as pointed out above, was not the originator of this 
organic view of the world, but accepting the general 
view from his predecessors and contemporaries, he 
assembled and organized such a mass of concrete 
evidence in support of it, and presented it in such a 
popular, readable, and logical form as to give the 
organic view of the world an almost universal currency 
among thinking readers. In this respect his was with- 
out doubt the most distinct contribution of the last 
seventy-five years to our better understanding of the 
world. 


3. Darwin’s Argument 

Why language, then, to man confined? 

The dog can say what ’s in his mind. 

Odd Rhymes. 

Darwin, though convinced of the organic unity of 
the world in its evolution from its lowest to its highest 
forms, did not succeed in completely establishing his 
conviction by logical proof or actual Evidence. There 
were at least two gaps in the development process that 
he saw no way of bridging: (a) the gap between in- 
organic and organic nature, and (b) the gap between 
organic nature without intelligence and organic nature 
with intelligence. In the third chapter of the Descent 
he writes: ‘In what manner the mental powers were 
first developed in the lowest organisms is as hopeless 

u 

So 



DARWIN 


an inquiry as how life itself first originated. These are 
problems for the distant future, if they are ever to be 
solved by man.’ Scientists since Darwin’s time, who 
believe with him that life and mind were not always co- 
present with matter in world history, but emerged at 
some given time from lifeless and mindless ancestry, 
have from time to time given attention to the first of 
these two problems, namely the connection between 
non-living and living matter, but have as yet made 
no measurable advance from Darwin’s position. Mr. 
Lloyd Morgan, speaking as a biologist in his latest book, 
Emergence of Novelty (1933), writes : ‘ Of the passage from 
matter to life, if it occurred as an original novelty, along 
a suite of emergent steps, we are as yet wholly in the 
region of evolutionary conjecture.’ 

But a third gap that was always thought to exist, 
Darwin, as noted above, did attempt to close, and, as 
far as the minds of what is called the intelligent public 
were concerned, succeeded in closing, at least for the 
last twenty-five years; the gap, namely, between the 
intelligence of the animals and the intelligence of man. 
Having successfully established the general evolutionary 
theory within the plant and animal life of the world 
in the Origin of Species, he was then confronted with 
the further question : ‘ In what relation does man stand 
to the rest of the animal life of the world ?’ This is the 
question which he answers in the Descent of Man, 1871, 
and the significant parts of that book are the third and 
fourth chapters, where he makes the * Comparison of the 



CLEARING THE WAY 


Mental Powers of Man and the Lower Animals. * He puts 
his view and purpose quite clearly in the opening lines 
of the third chapter. ‘My object in this chapter, ’ he 
says, ‘is to show that there is no fundamental difference 
between man and the higher mammals in their mental 
faculties.’ Recognizing that language is connected with 
the mental faculties, Darwin includes his now well- 
known discussion of language in the closing part of the 
same third chapter. He opens the discussion with the 
following: ‘The faculty of language has justly been con- 

I sidered as one of the chief distinctions between man 
and the lower animals. But man, as a highly competent 
judge, Archbishop Whateley, remarks, is not the o nly 
animal that can make use of language to express what 
is passing in his mind^ and can understand more or less 
what is expressed by another. ... In Paraguay the Cebus 
Azarae when excited utters at least six distinct sounds, 
which excite in other monkeys similar emotions.’ The 
dog barks ‘in at least four or five distinct sounds.’ 
From accumulated evidence of this kind Darwin draws 
the conclusion at the end of the fourth chapter, to use 
his own words, that ‘the difference in* mind between 
man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is 
one of degree and not of kind.’ The same he holds to 
i be true of language. 

Throughout these two chapters Darwin supports his 
view of the identity of the various mental faculties of 
man with those of the lower animals, and of the identity 
of their languages, by the evidence of facts which he has 

S 2 &gt; 



DARWIN 


either observed himself or has received from other 
trustworthy observers. The facts which he presents in 
order to show that animals possess the various mental 
faculties and emotions which he ascribes to them, and 
language as well — in his connotation of language — 
would, I think, be accepted by every unprejudiced 
reader, except the facts and evidence submitted in his 
paragraph on the imagination. This exception turns 
out to be a very vital one, and we shall return to it later. 


4. The Evidence from Language against Darwin's View 

On the whole, man’s development and control over language 
is unquestionably the greatest single achievement which his in- 
telligence has compassed, and whether one thinks of it as cause 
or effect, its presence, more than any other one factor, is respon- 
sible for his enormous superiority to his animal neighbours. — 
The Evolution of Intelligence, J. R. Angfll, President of Yale 
University. 

Meantime there is one large body of facts that stands 
in contradiction to Darwin’s whole case. The animals 
and birds of nature have each, as he points out, a certain 
number of natural sounds — not the conventionalized 
sounds of language — say from one to twelve, that have 
significance for others of their kind ; and these sounds, 
he maintains, must be called language, because they do 
not differ from the language of man except in degree of 
distinctness. Ancestral man, if our theory of natural 
evolution is true, had also in his early natural life a 



CLEARING THE WAY 


certain number of natural sounds, say twelve, that had 
significance for his own kind, and perhaps for other 
animals about him. Now, there are two things to be 
noted in these natural sounds as we find them among the 
animals and birds of to-day, and as we assume they were 
with preconscious man, two things which distinguish 
them from language. 

First, they are natural sounds, and consequently in- 
definite in significance. They are like the few mere 
exclamations or cries of pleasure or pain which man 
still uses and which convey to the hearer no definite 
significance, either of the kind of pain or of the specific 
cause of it. We call these cries interjections, i.e. un- 
conventionalized sounds interjected into the structure of 
language proper. They are somewhat analogous to the 
sounds of instrumental music which affect the mind of 
the hearer only in a vague and undefined way. 

Second, the animals do not increase the number of 
their few natural sounds, nor do they show any impulse 
or tendency or need to increase them as time goes on, 
except where man deliberately interferes in order to 
effect a temporary increase in the imitative vocabulary, 
say, of the parrot. The few instinctive natural sounds 
without increase seem to satisfy the needs and capacity 
of the animal’s mind, and to correspond with its nature. 

These two things bring us to the point of difference 
between man and the animals with respect to language. 
At some time and, as it seems to me, from some crea- 
tive and purposive force at work in the world, there 



DARWIN 


emerged into life within the mind of man a new power 
or faculty for explicitly differentiating the objects of the 
world, both in their distribution in Space and their 
succession in Time; and with this awakened power of 
explicit differentiation a consequent need and corre- 
sponding impulse for something far more definite and 
elaborate than the few nebulous or misty-edged natural 
sounds which satisfied his preconscious needs. And 
eventually with this new power of explicit differentia- 
tion, and his urge to actualize it, man got started upon 
a free course, first, of shaping these vague natural sounds 
into definite-edged or definitely articulated sounds — 
words, as we now call them — that could be clearly 
distinguished from one another; and second, of in- 
vesting each definite sound with a definite meaning, a 
conventional and arbitrary meaning as distinguished 
from the vague natural significance of natural sounds; 
and third, of increasing or multiplying without limit 
the number of these definitely-shaped conventionalized 
sounds. By these three things, the definite shaping of 
natural sounds, the conventionalization of their mean- 
ing, and their multiplication without limit, man has — 
elaborated out of his few original sounds an immense 
structure of articulate language whose parts are as dis- 
tinctly differentiated and organized as are the objects 
of the natural world which this language fabric now 
reflects. The two conventionalized sounds ‘dog’ and 
‘cat,’ for example, are as clearly differentiated from 
one another as are the two natural objects for which 




CLEARING THE WAY 


they stand. Meantime, the animal world lies un- 
awakened at man’s feet without, as we said, showing 
any need, impulse, or power for transmuting their 
natural cries into articulate sounds, investing them with 
conventional meanings, or increasing their number. 

This is an enormous difference between man and the 
animals, a difference in actualized fact not in theory, 
too obvious to be questioned when attention is called 
to it, and too significant to be overlooked; and it 
stands, as I have said, in unequivocal contradiction to 
the whole tenor of Darwin’s arguments. It is true, as 
remarked above, that certain birds under man’s in- 
struction can be taught, by some kind of instinctive 
imitation of both sound and content, to increase the 
number of their own natural sounds ; but they show no 
power of breaking through the ‘charmed circle of 
nature,’ in which they are in some way confined, into 
the realm of free and conscious mind where articulate lan- 
guage has its birth and growth, and in which man now 
‘lives, moves, and has his being.’ 

Now this shaping and conventionalization of natural 
sounds, giving to each a definite form and specific con- 
notation, and the consequent free unlimited cumula- 
tive development of human language as contrasted with 
the few, fixed, stationary, uncumulative, natural cries 
of animals must be due to some very real difference 
in their respective mental powers. To say that this 
difference is merely a difference in ‘degree’ and not in 
‘kind’ of intelligence at this stage of the inquiry tells 

S 6“ 



DARWIN 


us nothing. Man has broken through some barrier 
which, up to the present time at least, encloses the 
minds of the animals, and the plain scientific question 
confronting us now is: ‘What is the difference between 
the two?’ , _ 

v « 

/ 

j. ‘Kind 1 and ‘ Degree ' 

To clear the way toward an exact answer to this 
question a word should be said first upon the diction to . 
be used. There is no longer any profit to be gained 
by dwelling upon the question which Darwin took as 
the starting point and pivot of his discussion sixty-six 
years ago, the question whether this difference between [ 
animals and man is one of kind or degree. The two I . 
words, as already noted, were never clearly defined or 
differentiated, although at that time they did stand, in 
a general way, for two different points of view, two 
opposing schools of thought, and Darwin’s use of them 
was perhaps the most effective method for breaking 
down the traditional dualistic view, and removing the * 
prejudice that stood in the way of a free scientific con-^ 
sideration of the whole question. But now that the 
prejudice is gone, the original need of the two words 
in their general significance has disappeared, and they 
have no sufficiently precise significance that would 
render them useful at the present advanced stage of the 
inquiry. What we now need is an exact and concrete 

* 57 



CLEARING THE WAY 


marking of specific likenesses and differences, and these 
two long-bandied-about words are no longer accurate 
enough for that purpose. The vagueness of their con- 
notation, overlooked in their former general use, be- 
comes apparent as soon as one attempts to use them 
with precision, so that they cloud the issue instead of 
clearing it. To reassure myself on this point I recently 
asked a well-known biologist if he could give me from 
the whole field of biology one clear example of a differ- 
ence which scientists would unequivocally agree upon 
as a difference in kind, and another which they would 
agree upon as a difference in degree, so that there 
would be no longer any doubt about the precise mean- 
ings of the two words. He was unable to give the 
required examples. I have since put the query to a 
number of other scientists and psychologists with no 
better luck. 

This alone makes it clear that to get forward now in 
the investigation we must discard these two misty 
words. And since the organic unity of the world in- 
cluding man — thanks chiefly to Darwin — seems to be 
now pretty generally accepted, we might assume all 
differences to be differences of degree only ; and assum- 
ing this, we may profitably discard both words and 
speak simply of differences, differences in the explicit 
forms of life and mind which have successively emerged 
in the spiral course of evolutionary advance. 

Some of these differences, however, and among them, 
as I shall try to show, the difference in mental power 

5 *' 



DARWIN 


between man and the animals, are vital and significant; 
and although misconceived as totally disparate realms 
in pre-Darwin times, their legitimate boundaries have 
been blurred during the last sixty years through the 
pressure for unity by Darwin and the neo-Darwinians. 
But now that the pressure is relaxed by the lapse of 
time and the disappearance of opposition, these differ- 
ences are emerging into notice again, and the time has 
come in our thinking when their characteristic differ- 
ences must be analysed and described closely and con- 
cretely, and their significance specifically marked in 
relation to one another and to the general underlying 
unity. For this closer work, general categories like 
‘kind’ and ‘degree’ can render no service. A more 
precise diction is required. 

Realizing then the difference described above be- 
tween the large and rapidly growing structure of the 
articulate language of man, and the meagre static body 
of the natural sounds of animals, we are confronted with 
the plain concrete question: What is this difference in 
mental power that has enabled man to so ‘get the 
start’ of the natural world and ‘bear the palm alone’? 
Is the difference of such a kind as can be concretely 
analysed and described so as to set out the significant 
characteristics of the human mind in clear and de- 
finite differentiation from the background of animal 
intelligence ? 

I think it can be so described, and if one can succeed 
in doing this one should be able to come fairly upon 

* S 9 



CLEARING THE WAY 


the origin of language, and its nature as a phenomenon 
in the world; for language, as I think can be shown, 
arose just out of this difference, arose in answer to the 
new mental problem that confronted man when he 
emerged from the realm of animal nature into the 
realm of free mind. 


6. The Fallacy in Darwin’s Method 

I — this thought which is called I — is the mould into which the 
world is poured like melted wax. — E merson, The Transcen- 
dentalist, 1842. 

Why, it may be asked, in the investigation of lan- 
guage origin, should one go back to Darwin when so 
much has been written since both on evolution and 
on language? The answer is that Darwin’s name still 
stands at the centre of the modem point of view, and 
while his views on language in 187 1 have not altered 
to any extent the progress of the specific science of 
language since that time, they have altered in a ver y 
s ignificant way our philosophy or gene fal conception of 
l anguage i n relat ion tn o ther phenomena in the world s 
They have, as a matter of fact, from the date of their 
publication deflected the philosophy of language from 
the natural course which it had been following for 
the previous hundred years, and the first step now 
in any new investigation is to correct if possible that 
deflection. 

60 ,J 



DARWIN 


In the Descent of Man, as noted above, Darwin under- 
took to complete the story which was begun in the 
Origin of Species by making the final connecting link 
between the animal intelligence and the intelligence 
of man, thus establishing his theory of the complete 
organic unity of the world. But, as also pointed out 
above, in his intuitive and right sense of organic unity, 
and in his strong desire to establish it by logical proof, 
he overlooked, and for the time obliterated, the car- 
dinal difference between the two. His oversight and 
obscuration of this difference was due to a lurking 
fallacy and a consequent fundamental error in his 
method of comparison. 

The error was summarily this: Throughout the dis- 
cussion he makes no inquiry into the nature of the total 
or central unifying mental faculty of man, nor of the 
corresponding central unifying mental faculty of the 
animals; nor does he make any comparison between 
these two. He proceeds by enumerating the separate 
sub-faculties, instincts and emotions, which psychology 
has differentiated within the total faculty of reason, and 
taking these one by one he finds by comparison that the , 
animals seem to possess them all in at least an incipient 
degree. He finds, for example, that the animals have 
the same senses as man, the same instincts, the same 
emotions, such as fear, terror, suspicion, courage, 
timidity, rage, revenge, as well as the more complex 
emotions of jealousy, shame, modesty, scorn, humour ; 
that they possess also the more intellectual emotions, 



CLEARING THE WAY 


such as wonder and curiosity; and that they show the 
same powers of imitation, attention, memory, imagina- 
tion, and reason. Finding no apparent difference in the 
operation of these differentiated sub-faculties in animals 
and in man, he merely adds up the results instead of 
unifying them ; and comes to the quite illegitimate con- 
clusion that there is no difference in the total faculty of 
reason in each ; no difference between the central uni- 
fying mental faculty of animals and the corresponding 
mental faculty of man — the nous, as Aristotle calls it in 
his Posterior Analytics — which co-ordinates and uses as 
its agents the differentiated sub-faculties, and which, in 
man, is conscious both of itself and its sub-faculties, 
and can examine and carry on a discussion about them 
as we are doing here. He moves forward in such a 
plain manner and with such clear matter-of-fact 
evidence, that the reader is seduced into the same 
logical error. 

But this method of reasoning and deduction is clearly 
not sound. We cannot pass at a jump from the apparent 
identity of these differentiated sub-faculties in man and 
the lower animals, to the identity of the central faculty 
of reason itself, which, as we have pointed out, in- 
cludes and uses as its instruments all these subordinate 
faculties. And the significant difference between man 
and the animals, which opened the way to articulate 
language for man, while restricting animals to natural 
cries, seems to be a difference in the central unifying 
faculty, and not in its subordinate agents. For this 

62, 



DARWIN 


reason the new investigation which follows here will 
consist in a comparison of the unified faculty of mind in 
man and the animals respectively, with a view to 
discovering the difference between the two which 
led man to articulate language and left the anim als 
without it.

THE NEW INVESTIGATION 




INTRODUCTION 


THE PROBLEM 

We must therefore see the whole varied qpngeries of living 
things as a single very ancient Being, of inconceivable vastness, 
and animated by one Spirit.’ — Samuel Butler, God the Known and 
God the Unknown. 

Science has opened all kinds of perspectives. In particular it 
has shown life as a slow upward-evolving process. It has shown 
that there is something in evolution which we must call progress, 
and it has shown that we ourselves are now trustees for any evolu- 
tionary progress that remains to be made. — Julian Huxley, 
Science and Social Needs, 1936. 

What, then, is the difference between the central uni- 
fying faculty of reason in man, out of which language 
arose, and the corresponding central faculty in the 
animals, which expresses itself in a few natural cries; 
and how in our present state of knowledge can this 
difference be distinctly brought into view and described 
in a concrete way? This is a complex question, and 
can be best answered for our purpose by breaking it 
into four parts. 

First. What was the actual nature of the world of 
matter, and of plant and animal life, before the awaken- 
ing of conscious reason in man? 

Second. What were the nature and characteristics 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


of the new mental power that then came to life and 
actuality in man? 

Third. What new problem came into existence with 
the emergence of this new mental power, that gave 
birth to the articulate and cumulative language of man ? 

Fourth. What was the predestined form and struc- 
ture of language to meet this new problem of free and 
conscious mind? 

I shall attempt a plain, concrete descriptive answer 

these four questions in order. 



CHAPTER I 


THE PRE-CONSCIOUS WORLD : A SPACE- AND-TIME PICTURE 

But deepest of all illusory Appearances are your two grand 
world-enveloping Appearances, Space and Time. — Carlyle, 
Sartor Resartus, 1830. 


I. The Space-Picture 

The Prime, that willed ere wareness was, 

Whose Brain perchance is Space, whose Thought its laws. 

Thomas Hardy, The Dynasts. 

Question one. What were the nature and charac- 
teristics of the world in its three main divisions of 
matter, plant life, and animal life, before it emerged to 
its fourth main division in the explicitly conscious life 
of man? The answer to this question carries us back- 
ward in time to a period so remote from the present 
that no answer Would be at all possible were it not 
that in his emergence to consciousness man rose above 
the time-stream of sense, and by the help of language, 
has been able to recover and reconstruct the otherwise 
irrecoverable past. While the actual sense-facts which 
constituted the natural environment contemporary with 
man's emergence have long since vanished in the stream 
of change, we know now, from our knowledge of the 

&lt;9 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


past and present, that in any piece of virgin timber or 
park land of to-day we should have, substantially and 
typically, the same natural environment from which 
man emerged thousands of years ago. We should have, 
first of all, the same inorganic world of fixed geographic 
relations and definite structures: sun, moon, stars, 
clouds, winds, waters, soil, rocks, etc. ; second, the 
differentiated forms of organic insentient life: grass, 
flowers, shrubs, trees, etc. ; third, the various forms of 
■sentient life: fishes, birds, reptiles, mammals; all these 
multitudinous forms, inorganic and organic, differen- 
tiated from each other and united with each other in a 
complete network of space, time, and causal relations. 
That, in epitome, is a space-picture of the world of 
nature as it confronts our eyes to-day, and the only 
significant animal absent from it, that we would have 
found in the old pre-cons cious world, is the natural 
animal-like progenitor of man. In his actualized life, 
however, at that period — if our evolutionary theory is 
the true one — he would be only one more animal whose 
actual presence, if we omit his potential destiny, would 
not alter the significant characteristics of the general 
picture. 


2. The Time-Picture 

Modem science and philosophy, however, have dis- 
covered that this contemporary space-picture has a 
history; that its present complex and highly differen- 



THE PRE-CONSCIOUS WORLD 


dated features are the product of a time-evolution ; and 
science and philosophy have also succeeded in recover- 
ing and reconstructing in its main outlines that past 
time-picture of the world which we require as the 
complement and interpretation of the contemporary 
space-picture. By drawing the outlines of this time- 
picture, and noting the significant differences that came 
into explicit existence as the developing force at work 
in the world emerged from inorganic to organic insen- 
tient life in the vegetable world, and again from - 
insentient to sentient life in the animal world, we shall 
be able to see more distinctly the significant charac- 
teristics that came to life and actuality in the last step 
from inconscious sentient to conscious sentient life, i.e. 
man. To outline this time-picture and mark as we go 
the significant emerging differences will be our next 
step, and, at the risk of appearing elementary, I shall 
do this very simply and with considerable detail. 

Furthermore, I shall construct the picture on the 
hypothesis of the complete organic unity of the world 
from matter to mari. I assume, in other words, that 
man in his complete life, his mental powers and his 
moral purposes, no less than in his physical organism, 
is a natural product and a natural part of the world; 
and that in the general evolution of the matter-life-and- 
mind of the world man eventually emerged from some 
original diffused or permeating life-and-mind force into 
an actual, individualized, objective organism and ex- 
plicitly purposive agent as we now find him. To regard 

* 7 i 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


man’s physical organism as having come out of the 
world by natural evolution, and his mental powers and 
moral aims as having come in some accidental way from 
other than natural sources, is a dualism of modem mecha- 
nistic thought which seems as naive from a philo- 
sophic point of view as any of the older superstitions 
which it has replaced. If the world is in verity the 
organic unity which we claim it to be, then man is not 
merely in the world or on it. He is the world at the 
highest point of its physico-mental life that we know on 
this planet; and the specific purpose of the present 
treatise is to differentiate this last phase of the world, 
that has emerged to actuality in the body and mind of 
man, from its next lower phase in animal life. 

A large part of the contemporary space-picture out- 
lined in the preceding section is made up of distinctly 
differentiated organic forms of both insentient and sen- 
tient life. But there was a period in the time-picture 
of the world, if we can trust our science, when none of 
these differentiated organic forms were to be found in 
actualized existence upon the earth’s surface; a time 
when only those forms or formations which we now 
call inorganic could be found in actual existence there. 
If a company of modem scientists could at that period 
have stepped upon this globe with their fully equipped 
modem laboratories they might have given an adequate 
explanation of all they found by means of the physical 
sciences alone, mathematics, physics, chemistry, geo- 
logy, etc. It would be a material world organized in 

J2&gt; 



THE PRE-CONSCIOUS WORLD 


the media of space and time, and explained by the 
mechanical laws of ‘matter, motion, and force.* That 
the earth had a long pre-organic history, a long evolu- 
tion of changing and developing inorganic formations 
before the concrete living forms emerged upon its sur- 
face, seems now to be reasonably certain. What the 
specific nature or duration of this pre-organic history 
may have been does not materially affect our present 
purpose. 

Our interest begins with the emergence of life, and ' 
here we are met with a problem that is still unsolved. 
‘How life itself first originated’ was, in Darwin’s esti- 
mate in 1871, a ‘hopeless inquiry,’ ‘a problem for the 
distant future if it is ever to be solved by man.’ Mr. ( , 
Lloyd Morgan writes in 1926: ‘There is as yet no plain j j 
tale of the passage from the non-living to the living’ 
(Life, Mind, and Spirit, p. 77). The problem is still in 
the dark as far as spepific or scientific knowledge of it is 
concerned, so that in our present discussion we are 
obliged to start from one of the two hypotheses that 
are put forward regarding it, the Mechanistic and the 
Organic ; and since the one or the other of these hypo- 
theses is, in our present state of knowledge, a necessary 
starting point for any complete world-view of evolu- 
tion, I shall suspend for a few pages the development 
of the specific time-picture which we have begun, in 
order to give a brief statement of the two hypotheses. 

I am aware of the danger in attempting an abridged 
statement of these two opposing views. One finds so 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


many variations in the various presentations of the two 
theories by writers who are in professed agreement 
that it would be vanity to think of being able to make 
any abstract of either theory that would win the unani- 
mous assent of its supporters. Each writer of any 
consequence makes some modification of his predeces- 
sors’ views, and adds something of his own, and the 
reader’s own view is altered somewhat by each new 
book, so that he is often not sure of how to state his 
own position. If asked, e.g. whether I am a ‘creative’ 
or ‘emergent’ evolutionist, I would answer ‘both,’ 
though that might appear to some as a hopelessly non- 
discriminative answer. All I can do here is to give a 
succinct statement of my own understanding of the two 
different views and incur the ensuing risks. 


'74 



CHAPTER II 


THE MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESIS 

I have spoken of variations sometimes as if they were due to 
chance. This is a wholly incorrect expression; it merely serves 
to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each par- 
ticular variation. — Darwin. 

Both the mechanistic and the organic hypotheses agree 
that in the world as it stands at present we find not only 
matter, but also life, mind, and purpose. The mecha- 
nistic hypothesis, however, as I understand it, holds 
that this earth was originally a purely inorganic world 
' without life, mind, or purpose, governed by purely 
K mechanical laws alone ; and that at some point of time 
1 in the relatively recent past, life got started upon the 
surface of this mechanical world by some kind of ‘bio- j 
logical accident,’ and having got started in ‘one or more 
primordial forms ’* it then set out on a course of evolu- 
tion impelled by a strong reproductive impulse, pre- 
sumably co-accidental with life itself; and with a strong 
tendency to reproduce or repeat the type, coupled 
with a lesser tendency to slight variations and an 
occasional tendency to a great variation, it gradually 
differentiated its ‘one or more primordial forms’ into 
many genera and species of life, each species or genus then 

Is 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


moving forward towards greater and greater perfection 
under the operation of ‘natural selection,’ until we 
have the multi-variegated organic world as we find it 
to-day. 

Upon this hypothesis the non-vital material world is 
; alone basic and permanent. Life, mind, and purpose 
1 are temporary phases which have come into existence 
in some accidental or unknown way at a certain point 
of time, and which may disappear again at some future 
time through the mindless and purposeless operation of 
the mechanical laws of the basic non-vital material 
world. In the meantime, to preserve a consistent 
world-unity, life, mind, and purpose must be explained, 
so far, at least, as scientific explanation is possible, by 
mechanistic laws similar to those which operate in the 
purely physical world. 

This might be loosely called the neo-Darwinian 
hypothesis; though Darwin himself remained inclined 
either towards a dualistic view — the original creation of 
some ‘simple archetypal creature,’ with the possibility 
of subsequent differentiations under chance variation 
and natural selection — as indicated, for example, in the 
closing paragraph of the Origin of Species, or towards a 
suspended judgment about it, as in the sentences quoted 
at the beginning of this chapter. 

There are, however, some difficulties in the hypo- 
thesis that should be noted here. In the first place, 
nearly all the significant words used to set out the theory 
were originally merely tentative terms used of necessity 

7 « 



THE MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESIS 

to describe processes that were as yet inexplicable. But 
these tentative terms by repetition and consequent 
familiarity have tended more and more to become 
accepted as explanations of the phenomena rather than 
tentative descriptions. Hence their tendency to obscure 
or conceal without explaining the problem. 

The word ‘accident,’ for example, when used with 
reference to the first appearance of life, may imply 
either that (i ) the first phenomenon of life had 
actually no causal connection with the pre-life matter' 
of the world, or only that (2) the causal connec- 
tions are not yet discovered. If the former is implied, 
then it stands in contradiction to the fundamental 
assumption of all science, namely, that every event has 
a cause. If the second, then it is merely an admission 
of present ignorance. In neither case does it give any 
explanation of the phenomenon ; but by frequent repe- 
tition of the word we get into the habit of thinking that 
it is an explanation. 

Again ‘reproductive impulse’ merely names an essen- 
tial factor in life without explaining it. An explanation 
would involve softie knowledge of the origin and sig- 
nificance of this ‘impulse.’ When, how, why did this 
impulse get into the world-machinery? The tendency, 
however, is to accept the name as if it were an explana- 
tion. Similarly a ‘tendency to variation’ comes to be 
accepted as an explanation, so that the mind stops short 
of the real and scientific questions: Where did the 
‘tendency’ come from, and what is its role in world 

1l 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


history; what causes the ‘variation,’ and for what pur- 
pose? Are these also to be described as ‘accidental,’ 
and, if so, what does the term specifically mean? Did 
the ‘tendency’ and ‘variation’ originally come without 
a cause, or did they emerge from some causal source as 
yet undiscovered? And where are the ‘tendency’ and 
the ‘variation’ leading to? 

It becomes obvious, when examined closely, that this 
first hypothesis of an original world of purely non-vital 
'matter, if tested by the standards of other knowledge, is 
not even a tentative explanation of the origin of life. 
Darwin himself was fully aware of this, as is shown in 
the closing sentences of the Origin of Species, where, in 
a very memorable last paragraph, he sums up the view 
of the world which he has developed in detail through 
four-hundred-odd pages. 

It is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with 
many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with 
various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through 
the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed 
forms, so different from each other, and dependent upon each 
other in so complex a manner, have all bean produced by laws 
acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being 
Growth with Reproduction ; Inheritance, which is almost implied 
by reproduction ; Variability from the indirect and direct action 
of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse ; a Ratio of In- 
crease so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a conse- 
quence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character 
and Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of 
nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which 
we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the 

7 « 



THE MECHANISTIC HYPOTHESIS 

higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view 
of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed ■. 
by the Creator into a few forms or into one ; and that, while this 
planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, 
from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and 
most wonderful have been and are being evolved. 

/ 

The significant words in this paragraph from our 
point of view, are: ‘this view of life, with its several 
powers, haring been originally breathed by the Creator into 
a few forms or into one.’ Darwin apparently saw that- 
this, or something akin to it, was an essential link in the 
spiral chain of his evolution theory, the link between 
lifeless and living forms. Some Neo-Darwinians, I 
fancy, might explain this phrase of Darwin’s as either 
a conciliatory concession to contemporary opinion, or 
as a carry-over from his pre-scientific religious beliefs, 
which he was not yet quite ready (1859) to abandon, 
but which the more confident of the mechanistic 
scientists of the present time would naturally reject 
as an inconsistent ingredient. 

To one, however, who tries to work out a concrete 
philosophical view of the world as a whole, on the basis 
of a time-evolution of all its forms from matter to man, 
the mechanistic hypothesis appears at the present junc- 
ture to obscure the real problem of the beginnings of 
life by taking on the semblance of an explanation with- 
out the reality. The large and increasing acceptance 
of this hypothesis during the present century, at least 
on the American continent, is due, I think, first, to its 

49 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


reiterated claims of being the only thoroughgoing 
scientific method of explanation, and second, to the 
general revolt against the old dogma of external design 
and direction, a revolt which has rather outlived its 
usefulness. 



CHAPTER in 


THE ORGANIC HYPOTHESIS 

It is a long way from granite to the oyster; farther yet to Plato 
and the preaching of the immortality of the soul. Yet all must 
come as surely as the first atom has two sides. — Emerson, 
Nature, 1841. 


1. The Attest of Logic 

How can purposive forms of organization arise without a 
purposive working cause? How can work full of design build 
itself up without a design and without a builder? — Kant, The 
General History of Nature, tysf. 

But there can be no reasonable doubt that living matter, in due 
process of time, originated from non-living ; and if that be so, we 
must push our conclusion farther, and believe that not only living 
matter, but all matter, is associated with something of the same 
general description as mind in the higher animals. We come, 
that is, to a monistic conclusion, in that we believe that there is 
only one fundamental substance, and that this possesses not only 
material properties' but also properties for which the word 
mental is the nearest approach. — Julian Huxley, Essays of a 
Biologist, 1926. 

The organic hypothesis holds that the world was at no 
time of its evolution a merely purposeless mechanical 
world, in which matter was prior to mind in the time 
order. The real original world was already and always 
a world of matter, life, mind, and purpose, actual or 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


latent. Matter on this hypothesis is regarded not as 
an independent substance in its own right, but as the 
means or material through which the life and mind of 
the world works itself out from its potential to its actual 
destiny. The life-force, or mind-force, or whatever 
we may call it in its earlier stages, works within the 
sensuous material of the world, and gradually shapes 
and moulds this material first into what we now call in- 
organic formations, and then, in the ripeness of time 
and environment, into those organic forms in which the 
life-principle rises into recognizable living shapes, and 
emerges into actual objective existence. On this view 
evolution through the reproductive impulse, the per- 
sistence of the general type with certain tendencies to 
variation, natural selection, etc., is not the directing 
agency, but the method by which the directing agency, 
the life-and-mind force, works itself out to actuality. 

Upon this hypothesis life, mind, and purpose are not 
temporary and accidental, but basic and permanent 
elements in the world ; potential and latent — so far at 
least as human perception upon this planet is concerned 
— in the first aeons of their history, and emerging to 
actuality at a certain point of time in the world evolu- 
tion. With the actual emergence of these new phases of 
the world there emerge also new principles of activity 
that were not in objective operation in the pre-life 
period of the world, and whose mode of working could 
not have been predicted by any human study of non- 
living matter. 


82, 



THE ORGANIC HYPOTHESIS 

This view does not stand in contradiction to the 
mechanistic laws of nature. The mechanistic laws 
are considered as the means by which the vital force 
advances from potential to actual life-forms. I call it 
‘vital force’ because one has to use some known term 
to describe it, and while its inner nature is still un- 
known, this term seems to come closer to a description 
of its objective behaviour than any other term we have. 
That the vital force, the life principle, works by me- 
chanical means which biology, physiology, etc. , are busy 
exploring, is no evidence at all that the vital force itself 
is mechanistic, in the accepted connotation of that 
word; and to call a living organ a ‘mechanism,’ in the 
same sense as one would speak about a machine, seems a 
sheer confusion or denial of significant characteristics 
by which we distinguish one thing from another. 

This modem error — for so, at least, it seems to me 
— of characterizing life-activity as mechanism seems to 
have arisen from a too exclusive concentration (a) upon 
the causal relations among the various physical parts 
within the individual organism itself, and (b) upon 
the relation between the individual organism and its 
physical environment, until by the mere accumulation 
of the details of these physical causal relations, internal 
and external, the central unifying life-force is buried 
out of sight. Eventually the life-force itself, too elusive 
to be caught by the mechanical mode of investigation, 
and now hidden from view under the growing mass of 
details of its external behaviour, is denied altogether, 

- 83 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


and the aggregate of its behaviouristic relations substi- 
tuted for it. This is an easy but unsatisfactory method 
of disposing of the most difficult element in the whole 
problem. 

When, for example, a dog crosses a street, you have 
forty pounds of matter moved and directed by an auto- 
matic force within the dog’s skin. When the dog is 
suddenly killed by an automobile you have the same 
size, shape, and avoirdupois of matter lying upon the 
street, still subject to all the mechanistic laws of non- 
vital matter, but without any powers now of rrioving 
itself from within. It can be moved now only by con- 
tact with physical force from without. The inner life- 
force that formerly moved it from within, without any 
impact from material force from without, is gone. The 
difference is enormous ; as great as any difference which 
comes within the realm of knowledge. To call this 
life-force mechanistic in the same sense as the disin- 
tegrating chemical changes that are now going on within 
the dog’s dead body are mechanistic, or in the sense in 
which the dog’s dead body may be moved by an external 
force, is merely, as we have said, to Confuse all those 
boundaries of knowledge by which we differentiate one 
phase of reality from another. Life or life-force may 
have to be re-defined so as to show more closely its 
connection with the mechanistic forces of the matter 
through which it works, but to discard the word be- 
cause the common connotation is now not sufficiently 
precise, and to replace it by a word that refers primarily 

»4 * 



THE ORGANIC HYPOTHESIS 

to lifeless relations, can afford no help to clear thinking, 
unless its temporary use and its felt inadequacy may 
operate as the gad-fly for stimulating the mind to a new 
definition of the old term ‘life.’ 

This second hypothesis, that life, mind, and purpose 
are permanent elements in the world, though their 
emergence in individualized objective forms may have 
occurred at a particular point of time in world evolu- 
tion, on this planet at least, is the hypothesis which I 
have adopted here, because it appears the more scientific 
and logical, and is more in accord with our complete 
experience of the world at the present time. Upon 
this view the emergence of living forms upon the earth’s 
surface would be neither a miracle nor an accident, but 
a next causal advance, predestined by some creative 
and purposive energy inherent in the world, in the 
evolution of life and mind from its potential to its actual 
existence. While this is .a hypothesis only and not an 
explanation of the emergence of life and mind any more 
than is the mechanistic view, it does leave the way open 
for a logical explanation without any break in the cause- 
and-effect sequehce. It is the hypothesis put forward 
by Kant, the first of the moderns, as already observed, 
to give vital expression to the evolutionary theory as 
an explanation of the present world of living forms. 

Though Kant was a mechanist within the realm of 
knowledge which encompassed, as he put it, the 
‘phenomenal’ world (The Critique of Pure Reason, 1781 ), 
he saw that mechanistic categories could not explain all 

' 8 s 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


experience, and especially the obligations of duty; and 
so he postulated a ‘noumenal’ world (The Critique of 
Practical Reason , 1788), which lay beyond the boun- 
daries of cause-and-effect knowledge, but was never- 
theless real, and related to the ‘phenomenal’ world 
through a unifying purposiveness. His summarized 
statement of the hypothesis regarding the generation of 
the organic world under a purposive force is worth 
quoting here because it is one of the earliest statements 
we have of the theory, and because it appears in Kant’s 
last book, The Critique of Judgment (1790), the ‘coping- 
stone,’ as he said, of his philosophy, and is his final 
judgment after a long life of devotion to science and 
philosophy. 

Here [he says], it is permissible for the Archaeologist of nature 
to derive from the surviving traces of its oldest revolutions, 
according to all its mechanism known or supposed by him, the 
great family of creatures (for so we must represent them if the 
said thoroughgoing relationship is to have any ground) which 
exists in the world to-day. He can suppose the bosom of mother 
earth, as she passed out of her chaotic state (like a great animal) 
to have given birth in the beginning to creatures of less purposive 
form, that these again gave birth to others which formed them- 
selves with greater adaptation to their place of birth and their 
relations to each other; until this womb, becoming torpid and 
ossified, limited its births to definite species not further modi- 
fiable, and the manifoldness remained as it was at the end of the 
operation of that formative period — only he must still in the end 
ascribe to this universal mother an organization purposive in 
respect of all these creatures ; otherwise it would not be possible 
to -think the possibility of the purposive form of the products of 
the animal and vegetable kingdom. He has then only pushed 

86 « 



THE ORGANIC HYPOTHESIS 


further back the ground of explanation and cannot pretend to 
have made the development of those two kingdoms independent 
of the condition of final causes. 1 

Kant’s view here, if one can simplify it by explana- 
tory paraphrase, is that all the specific forms which we 
find in the world to-day were produced by the purposive 
activity of a mind-force working in and through the 
sensuous matter of the world, and shaping-out these 
diversified organic forms as the means of realizing in^ 
an objective way its own potential destiny. In other 
words, Kant believed that the present manifold diflferen- 1 
tiated forms of the world are the result of a complete 
and thoroughgoing inner purposiveness of the world, 
working its way, especially in its early history, upward , 
and outward through sensuous matter, from the lowest 
forms of organic life up to and into the life of man. Iqj 
man, however, this inner inconscious purposiveness 
emerges to consciousness and begins to work now, 
through man’s brain and hand, in an explicitly pur- 
posive manner upon the matter of the world, imposing 
new purposive forms upon this matter now from the 
outside (the artificial world, or world of art, as we now 
call it), as contrasted with the purposive forms (the 
organic forms of nature) previously shaped by the same 
purposive activity of the world working embryonically, 
as we might say, from the inside. 

Upon this view the plant, the tree, the bird, the 

1 This paragraph follows upon the paragraph quoted from Kant above, 

p. 21. 

- 87 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


animal, and man, are the forms which the world by its 
creative activity has shaped into these objective expres- 
sions of its own evolving life. Professor Haldane has in 
a different form expressed the same view, as I under- 
stand him, in Mechanism, Life, and Personality, where he 
maintains that when the present investigations of the 
problem are eventually carried out to their completion 
it will most likely be found that instead of mechanical 
law giving the explanation to life and mind, it will be 
life and mind and personality which will eventually 
give the explanation and significance of mechanical law 
and of what is now called inorganic matter. According 
to this view, then, with the actual emergence of life in 
individual organic forms upon the earth’s surface, the 
world advanced to a new phase of its evolution. Life, 
mind, and purpose, latent and potential in the pre- 
organic period, emerge to actuality in the organic 
world, in an ascending series from plant to man. 

Professor A. N. Whitehead, who, like Kant, is both 
a scientist and a philosopher, expresses in a paragraph 
the same view as Kant regarding the purposive nature 
of the world, and it is interesting to stee the two para- 
graphs side by side with an interval of some hundred 
and forty years between. 

There is clear evidence that certain operations of certain animal 
bodies depend upon the foresight of an end and the purpose to 
attain it. It is no solution of the problem to ignore this evidence 
because other operations have been explained in terms of physical 
and chemical laws. The existence of a problem is not even 
acknowledged. It is vehemently denied. Many a scientist has 

88 « 



THE ORGANIC HYPOTHESIS 


patiently designed experiments for the purpose of substantiating 
his belief that animal operations are motivated by no purposes. 
He has perhaps spent his spare time in writing articles to prove 
that human beings are as other animals so that ‘purpose’ is a 
category irrelevant for the explanation of their bodily activities, 
his own included. Scientists animated by the purpose of proving 
that they are purposeless constitute an interesting subject for 
study. 


2. The Intuition of Poetry 

Shall we not maintain, then, that Mind is the first origin and 
moving power of all that is, or has been, or will be, since it has 
been clearly shown that Mind is the source of change and motion 
in all things? — Plato, The Laws, c. 360 b.c. 

Even then I felt 

Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth 
And common face of Nature spake to me 
Rememberable things. 

Wordsworth, The Prelude, Book I, 1798. 

This conception of a vital purposive principle in the 
world received its first powerful intuitive expression 
in English literature in Wordsworth’s Prelude, a poem 
whose significance and originality in relation to modem 
views of the world are not yet fully realized. In this 
poem Wordsworth labours by all the devices of lan- 
guage — by concrete illustration, by philosophic exposi- 
tion, by poetry — to convey his knowledge (for so 
he calls it) of the organic and spiritual unity of the 
world which has been revealed to him through often- 
repeated mystic experiences; a knowledge, however. 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


which, in the end, he confesses to be incommunicable 
through the ordinary resources of words, except to 
the kindred mystic whose own personal experience can 
piece together the broken arches of common speech. 
It is the knowledge of immediate contact. ‘I ha ye felt 
a presence’ is the statement which he reiterates with 
many variations throughout the Prelude. His thought, 
expressed in cold prose, is that Man is the apex of 
the pyramidal world structure, where the Mind which 
permeates the whole fabric emerges to the light of con- 
sciousness, and, in the organism and mind of man, be- 
comes the inheritor of all its own lower manifestations 
from the base to the top of the pyramid. But to Words- 
worth the Mind which comes out so clearly at the apex 
is already present and stirring at the very base, and may 
be felt there by the sensitive mind of man, though 
hidden from the reach of sense. This view of a living 
world, even in that portion of it which to sense appears 
as non-living matter, Wordsworth deduced from his 
own living contact with it, repeated in countless ex- 
periences from childhood, youth, and manhood. He 
gave the first powerful expression of the view when he 
was twenty-eight years old, in the now familiar though 
often unapprehended lines: 

And I have felt 

A presence that disturbs me with the joy 
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime 
Of something far more deeply interfused, 

Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, 

, And the round ocean and the living air, 



THE ORGANIC HYPOTHESIS 

And the blue sky, and in the mind of man; 

A motion and a spirit, that' impels 

All thinking things, all objects of all thought. 

And rolls through all things. 

It should be noticed that the ‘presence’ which he 
feels is a living ‘something’ which exists not only in 
the ‘mind of man,’ but in the ‘round ocean’ and the 
‘blue sky,’ and is discoverable through its immediate 
cause-and-effect relation with his own mind. The ‘joy 
of elevated thoughts,’ which he has experienced not" 
once but hundreds of times, is an effect, indubitable 
and profoundly significant, of which the ‘blue sky’ is 
the cause; and where others stop with the fact Words- 
worth presses on for the scientific interpretation of the 
fact. The ‘joy of elevated thoughts’ is a mental effect, 
and he deduces that the ‘blue sky’ and the ‘round 
ocean,’ which are its cause, and which to the senses 
and sense instruments appear as mindless phenomena, 
are in reality animated by mind, whose influences, 
while dead to the physical senses, are appropriable to 
the sensitive mind of man through immediate feeling. 
‘I have felt a Presence,’ he says. All of us have felt in 
varying degrees the same influences from what we call, 
from the sense level, inanimate nature, the sudden re- 
invigorating influence, for example, of a sunset after a 
fatiguing day’s work indoors. But while, as I have 
said, most of us are contented with the fact, Words- 
worth probed for the interpretation, and the unique 
value and originality of his great nature poetry, 1798- 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


1808, is due, first, to his vivid experiences of the mental 
joys offered us by nature; second, to his scientific ques- 
tionings about their cause ; and third, to his confidence 
that other less sensitive minds may, under the guidance 
of his poetry, become richer sharers of these joys by 
consciously seeking them. To indoor people whose 
minds are perturbed by ‘the many shapes of joyless 
daylight . . . the fretful stir unprofitable and the 
fever of the world,’ in a word, by all the vanities that 
seem inseparable from human society, Wordsworth 
reiterates in poem after poem the invitation: 

Come forth, and bring with you a heart 
That watches and receives. 

At a later period, 1814, when his vivid experiences 
of the mental nature of the entire world had decayed 
to little more than a memory of things that were, he 
gave a more explicitly philosophic, though less poetic, 
statement of his views : 

To every Form of being is assigned 
An active 1 Principle: — howe’er removed 
From sense and observation, it subsists 
In all things, in all natures; in the stars 
Of azure heaven, the unenduring clouds, 

In flower and tree, in every pebbly stone 
That paves the brooks, the stationary rocks. 

The moving waters, and the invisible air. 

Whate’er exists hath properties that spread 
Beyond itself, communicating good, 

A simple blessing, or with evil mixed; 

1 The italics are Wordsworth’s.

THE ORGANIC HYPOTHFSIS 


Spirit that knows no insulated spot, 

No chasm, no solitude; from link to link 
It circulates, the Soul of all the worlds. 

This is the freedom of the universe; 

Unfolded still the more, more visible, 

The more we know; and yet is reverenced least, 

And least respected in the human Mind, 

Its most apparent home. 

The Excursion, Book ix. 

While this ‘active Principle’ is not so ‘apparent’ in 
the lower orders of nature as it is in the human mind, . 
yet it may be felt everywhere throughout the realm of 
nature, if its awakened human form, man, is sensitive 
to mental affinities. 

Wordsworth also had an unalterable conviction that 
this ‘active Principle’ was a permanent and indestruc- , 
tible element in the world structure, as is shown in the ] 
following rather remarkable lines: 

Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes 
Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch 
Her pleasant habitations, and dry up 
Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare, 

Yet would the living Presence still subsist 
Victorious, and composure would ensue, 

And kindlings like the morning — presage sure 
Of day returning and of life revived. 

The Prelude, Book V. 

These lines express an integral element of the organic 
hypothesis which we have been discussing in this 
chapter. 

The main characteristic of Wordsworth’s interprp- 

9 3 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


tation of the world in The Prelude is that he carries the 
scientific method farther forward than do the scien- 
tists, beyond the bounds of matter into the realm of 
mind. He experiences, for example, a memorable 
stimulus of joy from the sight of the ‘floating cloud.’ 
This experience, as noted in a parallel passage above, is 
an effect of which the floating cloud is the cause. But 
the experience is fundamentally a mental one, and he 
reasons that the cause is also a mental reality, though 
embodied in a physical phenomenon, the cloud, and 
transmitted to the mind through the physical eye and 
the physical filaments that connect the eye with the 
cloud. Mind, to him, on the ground of cause and 
effect, is a real presence, not only in man, but also in 
nature, though its activity in nature — at least below 
the animal sphere — is not palpable to sense perception. 
The Prelude, as Coleridge pointed out, is fundamentally 
a philosophical poem, and is in a very real sense the 
original English text upon which all the expository 
work on creative or emergent evolution of the present 
century has been based, however unconscious the ex- 
positors may have been of Wordswofth’s pioneer work 
in the field. 

The laboratory scientist may be inclined to discount 
the poet’s evidence here on the ground that it is based 
on mystic or intuitive insight rather than on scientific 
observation and analysis. But Wordsworth was a close 
scientific observer and reasoner as well as a mystic, and 
in all original work both faculties are necessary. What 



THE ORGANIC HYPOTHESIS 


makes Plato the greatest of all philosophers is the fine 
commingling of steady observation and logical reasoning 
with a penetrative mystic insight. In the Ion, for 
example, Plato, by his mystic insight, brings us to the 
very life and springs of poetry which Aristotle misses 
entirely by his purely analytic method in the Poetics. As 
Bertrand Russell says in his illuminating essay on 
Mysticism and Logic : 

The greatest men who have been philosophers have felt the 
need of both science and mysticism. . . . Reason is a harmoni- 
zing controlling force rather than a creative one. Even in the 
most purely logical realm, it is insight that first arrives at what 
is new. 

In returning in the next chapter to the reconstruction 
of the time-picture of the evolution of the living forms 
in the world which we suspended two chapters back, 
I shall assume the organic hypothesis outlined above as 
the background for the construction of the picture. 
The concrete picture itself, however, is in no way 
hypothetical, but is drawn from empirical observation 
and objective evidence, and is submitted for scientific 
examination quite independent of the metaphysical 
hypothesis submitted above as a probable ultimate basis 
and explanation of the picture. 



CHAPTER IV 


THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE: THE TIME-PICTURE 
CONTINUED 

All changes pass without violence, by reason of the two cardinal 
conditions of boundless space and houndless time. Geology has 
initiated us into the secularity of nature, and has taught us to 
disuse our dame-school measures, and exchange our Mosaic and 
Ptolemaic schemes for her large style. . . . Now we learn what 
patient periods must round themselves before the rock is formed, 
then before the rock is broken and the first lichen race has dis- 
integrated the thinnest external plate into soil, and opened the 
door for the remote Flora, Fauna, Ceres, and Pomona to come 
in. How for off yet is the trilobitel how far the quadruped! how 
inconceivably remote is Man! Yet all duly arrive. — Emerson, 
Nature, 1841. 

The entire phenomenon of the organic world divides 
itself by its external behaviour into three well-defined 
classes, plant life, animal life, and man, each class with 
new and original characteristics of itS own. To trace 
and mark these new characteristics as they emerge in 
their time-evolution upwards through plant and animal 
life to where the life-and-mind of the world eventually 
emerges from its unfreed and inconscious activity to its 
freed and conscious activity in the life and mind of man, 
is our next step. 

I shall not attempt any analytic definition of either 

96. 



THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE 


life or mind, though that would be germane to our 
present purpose if it could be done ; nor any discussion 
of the detailed material structure or processes of life 
from the biological or physiological point of view, as 
that would fall outside our present purpose. While 
biologists have learned much of the material organism 
through which life manifests itself, they have not yet 
hit upon the thing itself, the life-principle, or whatever 
we may call it, that animates and unifies the organism. 
Some of them, as we have seen, hold it to be merely a 
mechanistic principle, others a vital formative principle, 
so that as far as knowledge is concerned the question is 
still in the realm of conjecture. I only wish to trace 
and describe some of the significant ways in which the 
life-principle manifests itself in its objective appearance 
and behaviour as we follow its evolution through an 
ascending series from lower to higher life-forms, and 
eventually to the highest form we know — man. 

By tracing the Time-picture in this way, and noting 
the new significant characteristics as they emerge in 
the ascending scale, we shall be able to see more dis- 
tinctly the actual' emergence and peculiar nature of the 
mental power in man that gave birth to language. The 
treatment will consist, as indicated above, in a series 
of descriptions of the significant forms and behaviour 
of the three cardinal classes of life: plant, animal, and 
man. 


.97 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


‘w i . Plant Life 

When life emerges in the vegetable world it emerges 
as an active and formative energy, with the power of 
gathering and forming a given quantity of matter into 
a certain predetermined and self-determining shape. 
J. S. Haldane writes of it thus: ‘Life manifests itself in 
two ways — as structure and as activity. But we also 
recognize — a biologist feels it in his very bones — that 
this is living structure and living activity.’ In order to 
work more directly to the end in view here, I shall sub- 
stitute for Haldane’s ‘structure’ and ‘activity’ the two 
words ‘individuality’ and ‘freedom,’ and change his 
sentence to read: ‘Life manifests itself in two ways 
— as individuality and as freedom,’ and add that as we 
ascend the life series those two features become more 
pronounced and significant. ‘Individuality’ includes 
* ‘structure,’ but connotes also, a little more explicitly, 
unity and definite boundaries. ‘Freedom,’ as used 
above, is almost synonymous with ‘living activity,’ 
except that it connotes a little more pointedly the idea 
of liberation, in a certain sense, from 1 ' mechanical law. 
But a more explicit and positive definition of the two 
terms may help towards clearness. 

By ‘individuality’ I mean that the delimited piece of 
matter which we call the plant has within itself an 
active and formative life-principle which draws around 
itself a certain quantity of stuff from its natural environ- 
ment, and organizes this into its own body with a 

98 . 



THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE 


definite and limited material form, whose parts have 
not only a definite spatial relation to each other, but 
are actively and vitally maintained in that relation. A 
quantity of inorganic matter, a stone, for example, has 
no individuality in the sense of actively related parts, 
whose spatial relations to each other depend upon the 
continuance of a vital unifying principle within the 
particular body. Break the stone into two parts and 
the shape of each half, and the spatial relations of the 
parts within each half, remain the same. Cut a branch' 
from an individual tree, on the other hand, so as to 
sever it from the unifying and form-sustaining life- 
principle, and thus abandon it to the influences of me- 
chanical laws alone, and in a given time these mechanical 
forces will destroy the definite formation of its parts 
and reduce its substance to formless matter. In the 
tree an active principle has emerged to visible actuality, 
that does not appear as actual in what we call non-living 
matter, though the formative energy which produced 
the tree must, as it seems to me, have been latent in the 
pre-life matter, according to all our conceptions of 
cause and effect. 

By attributing ‘freedom’ to the plant I mean that a 
new principle of activity has come to life within the 
material organism with a power of motion and work 
from its own centre, thus rising in some sense above 
the operation of mere mechanical law and mechanical 
motions, as we know these at present, where objects 
are moved only by external impact. The motions of 

' 99 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


an inorganic object, a stone, are determined solely by 
mechanical laws such as gravitation. Left unsupported 
in the air it will drop to the ground ; placed in water it 
will sink; set on an inclined plane it will roll to the 
bottom. In all cases its motion can be predicted by 
mechanical calculations. 

An organic object, on the other hand, a tree for 
example, manifests a new principle of motion as it 
organizes and raises its form and matter out of and 
above the earth’s surface. This motion is originated 
and carried on from within the tree, not from without, 
and this new kind of motion could not have been pre- 
dicted by any study of non-living matter previous to the 
appearance of plant life. In this self-active upward 
movement there is a certain liberation of this individual- 
ized living piece of matter from bare mechanical law, 
for the tree in a given time will organize several tons of 
matter into its own tree-substance and raise this up 
several feet above the earth’s surface in opposition, for 
I example, to the law of gravity. No non-living object 
has the power of raising itself in this way. 

As our language stands at present this new power of 
self-motion from within is best described as a mode of 
freedom to distinguish it from motion by impact from 
without, which we designate as mechanical motion. 
Something like this we are obliged to do if we are to 
describe characteristic differences at all. 

But this new motion of freedom is not a cancellation 
of the lower mechanical laws. The tree in its free 


IOOt 



THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE 


movement upwards is dependent, for example, upon 
the law of gravity for the very rise which it makes above 
the law. It raises its trunk perpendicularly in obedi- 
ence to the law and depends upon the constancy of the 
law for the steadiness of its rise. It uses also many 
other mechanical laws — which botanical science in- 
vestigates — as the means by which it accomplishes its 
growth, maintains its life, and realizes in this way its 
own particular degree of freedom ; and it depends upon 
the constancy of all these mechanical laws in order tcf 
rise to freedom at all. The freedom of organized plant 
life is thus not so much a freedom from mechanical law 
as it is a freedom obtained by means of mechanical law. 


2. Animal Life 

In the emergence to animal life the world advances to 
a new cycle in its evolution, embodies its life-energies 
in a more highly organized and self-contained indi- 
viduality with a higher degree of freedom. In this new 
cycle three new characteristics emerge to actuality 
that have significance in our time-picture: mind, self- 
motion, and purposive sound, or inarticulate language, as 
we usually call it for want of an exact name of its own. 
We shall consider these three in the order set down. 

(a) Mind 

What is mind? For the approach to language this 
question can be better answered by comparative de- 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


scription than by analytic definition ; and I shall attempt 
now to.^describe mind in its objective appearance and 
behaviour m ^gt ion to space-and-time, by comparison 
and conJfeistwitn body as represented in the lower cycle 
of plantl|ii|Wvhere mind does not yet explicitly appear. 

The tree*as noted above, has an organized and self- 
contained iifiividuality with an active power of selecting 
sensuous material from its environment, synthesizing 
this into its own individual form, and actively main- 
taining it in that synthesis. But its individuality does 
not extend, as we might say, beyond its own bark. It 
is contained within its own physical dimensions and 
stands confined to its own particular physical point in 
space and time. There is no perceptible power within 
the tree of reaching beyond its own physical boundaries, 
so that it does not differ significantly in that respect 
from any inorganic material object. It has, in other 
words, no actualized mind. 

In the animal, on the other hand, the new and unique 
power of mind has actually emerged from the creative 
and, as I think, purposive energies of the world. The 
animal has the same power of activfe assimilation and 
growth as the tree. Its body has similar limited and 
defined physical dimensions. But centred within its 
body is the new power which we now call mind, which 
through the avenues of the sense - organs of sight, 
hearing, and smelling, radiates or reaches out a certain 
distance into space and time, beyond the body’s limits, 
so that die animal’s individuality, by this new power of 

107 



THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE 

mind, extends beyond its own skin, beyond its own 
material body, and holds in its mental grasp, and actually 
occupies mentally, a much larger space-and-time en- 
vironment than the body occupies. In contrast with 
the plant whose individuality is confined to its own 
physical dimensions and which is thence confined to a 
physical world alone, the animal with its double body- 
and-mind nature lives in a double physical-and-mental 
world. The new phenomenon of mind and its corre- 
spondent mental world emerge together. 

This mental world which emerges as the habitation 
of this new power of mind in animal life is a non- 
material world which transcends the laws of the 
material world and the material bodies in it, as for 
example the law that two bodies cannot simultaneously 
occupy the same point of space. The living physical 
body in which the mind centres is subject to all the 
laws of the physical world as is any non-living material 
body; but the mind radiates, as we said, into a much 
larger region, so that the minds of two animals whose 
bodies occupy mutually exclusive regions of space can 
occupy a common mutually inclusive mental region. 
The difference between the two can be made objec- 
tively clear by an illustration, as also the difference 
between the plant and the animal with respect to this 
new power of mind. 

The two trees A and B stand separated from one 
another in mutually exclusive regions of space, the indi- 
viduality of each confined within itself. The physical 

♦ ,03 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 

bodies of the two animals, C and D, are in a similar 
way mutually exclusive. But the individualized mind, 
though centred or focused in the space-and-time- 
bound body, extends into the larger region represented 
by the circumferences of the two circles, E and F, and 
these two mental worlds are not mutually exclusive. 


A B 

Fig. i 

The greater portion of the occupied circles is common 
mental ground. This is a new phenomenon in the 
- world that could not have been predicted by any study 
of non-mental organic objects. 

Whether we are to speak of the animal’s mind as 
confined within its own body and looking out upon this 
larger world; or as merely centred or focused within 
the body and actually extending to the larger circumfer- 
ence, may be largely a matter of agreement upon the 
connotation of words. The latter, however, is the 
more accurate description of the phenomenon of mind. 
It is also in more direct agreement with Kant’s exposi- 

104 





THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE 


tion of space and time, as I understand Kant. But 
however we may describe it, it is clear that in animal 
existence the creative life-force of the world has pro- 
duced individualized material organisms through which, 
as physical space-time centres, the mind of the world 
emerges into some kind of individual consciousness of 
its surrounding environment of space and time, and 
takes some kind of mental possession of this. 

(b) Self-Motion 

Corresponding with its unique environing world of 
mind the animal has the new and unique power of self- 
motion. By means of this active power of motion 
within its own body, initiated, controlled, and directed 
by the mind, the animal can move itself from place to 
place within its larger mental world, and take succes- 
sive physical possession of it. 

But in this new movement of the world towards 

» 

freedom in animal life there is no cancellation of lower 
laws. The squirrel by its own power of motion from 
within, coupled with the law of gravity that keeps its 
feet firm upon the 'ground, can go up an inclined plane 
while the stone on the same plane will roll to the 
bottom. But the same law- which takes the stone down 
enables the squirrel to go up. The animal’s freedom 
rests upon the constancy of mechanical law. Simi- 
larly, the squirrel could not continue to subsist were it 
not that the oak tree remained constant to^its own oak- 
tree laws in producing acorns for the squirrel tt&gt; eat. 



TIIE NEW INVESTIGATION 


To speak in this way of the oak producing acorns for 
the squirrel to eat may at first sight seem like attribu- 
ting an unwarranted purposiveness to the system of 
nature. It is, admittedly, an external and bald way of 
putting it, and yet one can see no other alternative if 
one attempts to think out in detailed completeness 
the idea of the organic unity of the world. We are 
accustomed to think of the oak tree producing acorns 
to fulfil its own nature in reproducing and maintaining 
itself, rather than to feed the squirrels ; and to say that 
the squirrel must adjust himself to this nature of the 
tree, and to his environment in general, if he wishes to 
subsist. That seems the solider way of putting it be- 
cause the environment seems a much more durable, ‘ 
solid, and intractable thing than does any small anima j 
species like the squirrel that subsists within it, But I 
this appearance is surely due to the deception of the 
senses, and to a dualistic mode of thinking. As soon 
as the observer begins to think and speak particularly 
of a single small animal like the squirrel this animal 
immediately stands out alone in his mind in its small- 
ness and apparent insignificance against the entire and 
durable background of nature, and the observer, with 
these two unequal opposites objectively in his eye, for- 
gets for the moment the organic unity of the work 
which he theoretically asserts as the whole basis of hi 
thinking, and thinks and speaks of the squirrel adjusting 
itself in an &amp;xtemal way to its environment. He for- 
gets for-'the time that the environment and the squirrel 



THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE 


are only differentiated elements in a single self-differen- 
tiating world, whose life and mind are gradually 
emerging into concrete actuality through an ascending 
series of differentiated organic forms, where the higher 
cycle is, in each step, conditioned by and dependent 
upon the lower ; and that the world unfolding itself in 
this way could not have produced and sustained the 
more highly individualized life-organism of the squirrel 
with its power of self-motion, its senses, its finer as- 
similative organs, its half-freed, half-conscious mind, 
until it had first developed the plant life with its power 
of modifying the nutritive substance of the inorganic 
world over into that intermediated state, acorns, etc., 
|that could be assimilated as food by the more finely- 
|ATought organisms of animal life. The world, though 
* unfolding itself as a hierarchy in the successive steps of 
its evolution, appears, nevertheless, as a single, not a 
multiple, world, each higher order resting upon, sup- 
ported by, and evolving from the one beneath. Con- 
ceiving it this way, it seems more consistent to think of 
the creative world-force as evolving and directing the 
lower order, plant life, for example, with a view to the 
subsequent evolution and sustenance of the higher order 
^pf animal life, than to think of the animal as adjusting 
jtself to the lower plant order, when that lower order 
inust have been already adjusted both to the prospective 
life an,d subsequent sustenance of the animal before the 
animal could have come into existence a* all or have 
any prospect of continuing to exist. The squirrel does 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


not in fact adjust himself to his environment except in 
the most meagre degree. On the contrary he finds 
the environment already adjusted to his needs, and 
requires only a rudimentary instruction as to how to 
appropriate what he requires from this pre-adjusted 
environment. 


(c) Purposive Sound 

The third unique characteristic which, in the evolu- 
tion of the life-force of the world, emerges to actuality 
now for the first time in animal life is purposive sound, 
the cry or call by which one animal communicates with 
another. Mechanical sound which is made by exter- 
nal impact among solid or semi-solid material bodies 
expresses no purpose. It is the effect of the physical 
impact, and merely reports what has happened or is 
happening. Hence it has significance only in refer- 
ence to the past or concurrent present. The call of an 
animal is also no doubt a report of the animal’s present 
or immediate past state, but its chief significance is its 
reference to the future, towards some effect of which 
it is the intentional or purposive cause. The call of 
the wolf, for example, to rally the hunting pack. It 
explicitly anticipates time. In this way as expressing 
explicit purpose it resembles the language of man, and 
Darwin, as observed above, has actually established the 
habit of calling it language. But being inarticulate it 
is not really language, as 1 hope to show more clearly a 
little farther on, so I shall use a new word and call this 

l &lt;?, 8 



THE EMERGENCE OF ORGANIC LIFE 


purposive sound of animal-life ‘rudi-language,’ to dis- 
tinguish it from mechanical and non-purposive sound 
on the one hand and from language on the other. 

This rudi-language of the animals is the natural 
accompaniment of mind and locomotion. The three 
appear as being teleologically related. With the in- 
dividualized mind which holds an expanse of space 
beyond the body’s limits, and with the power of self- 
movement to take, in a given time, successive physical 
possession of this larger expanse, the animals have vocal 1 
organs by which they can produce these significant 
sounds for purpose of intercommunication within the 
larger expanse of their mental world, and for mutual 
physical co-operation within it. The plant, having no 
mind nor locomotion, has no language. The three 
things emerge together.

CHAPTER V 


ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 

I. Animal Cries and Language 

The goal of truth lies in a single point from which we can 
survey all sides and discover that no animal can invent language, 
that no God must invent it, and that man as a human being can 
and must invent it. — Herder, Origin of Language, 1772. 

Since these animal cries have purposive significance 
similar to that of language, in what respect do they 
differ from language? I shall try to give a definite 
answer to this question. 

First, they are inarticulate while language is articu- 
late. And what precisely does ‘inarticulate’ mean? 
It means (1) that these cries are not explicitly articu- 
lated sounds with clear-edged beginnings, middles, and 
endings, as are the word-sounds ‘h-a-p’ and ‘h-o-p,’ 
or ‘d-i-g’ and ‘d-i-p,’ so that one sound can be clearly 
and definitely differentiated from another; and (2) as, 
a corollary to this, the sounds have no conventional 
meanings; that is, they are not invested each with an 
arbitrary and definite connotation quite apart from any 
natural sound-suggestion which they may have, so that 
one sound stands exclusively for one thing, another 
sound- fdr another thing, as do the words of language 

1 10 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 

like ‘wolf’ and ‘bear.’ In other words, the animals’ 
cries are natural cries as distinguished from the conven- 
tionalized sounds which we call words, and they have 
the characteristic vagueness or indefiniteness of signifi- 
cance which all natural sounds have. In this respect of 
natural vagueness of significance the cries of animals 
resemble the mechanical sounds in nature, though 
differing from these in expressing purpose. They re- 
semble also in this respect the vagueness of instrumental 
music which is expressed also in natural mechanical 
sounds which have no explicit definiteness for the mind. 

Some more specific characteristics of the animal 
cries should be set down here to remove any possible 
ambiguity. 

(i ) It is true that the animal or bird does, as Darwin 
and other naturalists have pointed out, utter several 
natural'cries that can be distinguished from one another. 
But these cries all relate directly to their immediate 
physical needs or emotional moods, and are of three 
kinds: 

(a) Calls giving notice of the presence or prospect 

of food. * 

( b ) Calls of warning in the presence or prospect of 
danger. 

(c) Calls expressing feelings of joy or pain. 

(a) and ( b ) are natural vocal responses to the imme- 
diate physical environment, (c) is theSatpr^ssion of 
immediate feeling. The call to food is given By the 

i f i t 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


partridge only in the presence of food ; the warning cry 
for danger only in the presence of danger. While both, 
as we have said, refer to the future, it is always the near 
or immediate future. They stop there. The particu- 
lar cry is never separated from the particular environ- 
ment to which it is the natural response. 

(2 ) Because of the limited physical needs for which 
these calls are used, and because of the general vague- 
ness of their significance, these distinguishable calls are 
few in number, ranging from, say, one to twelve, and 
these few completely answer the bird’s needs. They 
do not increase in number. The partridge gives the 
same call in the presence of a dozen different kinds of 
food. Similarly in the case of danger. As natural 
sounds they are inarticulate and hence non-differentia- 
ting. When the dog barks, for example, outside the 
house, the bark intimates only that something is approach- 
ing, but leaves the human inmates of the house in doubt 
as to whether it is a man, horse, cow, wolf, bear, etc. 
The child goes to the door to ascertain what it is that 
is approaching and reports that it is a ‘man.’ The ar- 
ticulated sound ‘man,’ which he utters, explicitly differ- 
entiates the approaching object from all other possible 
alternatives, because ‘man’ is not a natural sound like 
the ‘wow’ of the dog, but a conventionalized sound; 
and it is this articulation and conventionalization of 
sound, (a) shaping it out with clear edges to distin- 
guish it frop^ther sounds, and (b) investing it with a 
definite limited meaning, that makes language. 

ii? 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 


Articulate language is a composite thing ; and in every « 
word there are three distinguishable elements, (a) The 
natural sound out of which the word is made. This is 


the raw material of language. The animal’s rudi-lan- 
guage stops here. ( b ) The definite shape given to this 

natural sound in its beginning, its middle, and its end, 
to separate it from other similarly shaped sounds. For 
example, the conventionalized sound ‘d-o-g’ has a 
definite distinguishable beginning ‘d,* a definite dis- 
tinguishable tone-body ‘o,’ and a definite distinguish- 
able ending ‘g,’ which, or any one of which, mark 
this sound off clearly from all other sounds, (c) This 
clearly shaped soundcis invested with a definite, limited, 
arbitrary (or conventional) meaning. The sound ‘dog’ 
stands for a particular object in nature, and is differen- 
tiated, both by its sound-shape and its conventional 
meaning, from its near - neighbour sound ‘hog’ as 
clearly as these two objects are differentiated from each 
other by their space-shape in nature. In the cries of 
animals the two last elements of language, namely (bf 
and (c), are absent. 

Since language? is a direct product of the mind, and 
since the language of man differs thus clearly from the 
rudi-language of animals, this difference in their utter- 
ances must signify certain differences in mental powers 
between the two. The language differences ought to 
give the clue to the mental differences if we can follow 


the logical deductions closely enough^_If the animal 
does not conventionalize sound so as to differentiate 


**3 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


one sound explicitly from another, and to multiply 
their number as man has done, it would seem to follow 
that he does not in his mind differentiate one object from 
another in space, or one event from another in time, in 
the explicit way that man differentiates them. Man’s 
power of explicit mental differentiation was what 
brought human language into existence. For example, 
looking around him in any given bit of spatial environ- 
ment, a man will differentiate by his eye and mind, 
say, fifty different objects, and will require fifty distin- 
guishable sound symbols, concrete nouns, to differen- 
tiate them in his mental world which he elaborates by 
language, and which, as I shall try to show in some 
detail farther on, corresponds in its parts and structure 
to the parts and structure of the natural world he is 
looking at. A dog standing by his side in the same 
environment shows no mental urge for any such clearly 
defined sound symbols at all, so that he evidently does 
not mentally differentiate the various objects with that 
distinctness which creates the need of language. There 
is little doubt that the dog can see as man does with his 
physical eyes, though perhaps not so clearly, but there 
seems to be no mental recognition, and hence no mental 
interest in or curiosity about the various differentiated 
objects which are before his eyes . Otherwise he would 
be urged to the making of mental symbols to designate 
them as man has been urged. He seems interested in 
material obje^Jg, in his environment only as they affect 
his physical needs. He sees the tree or thorn bush 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 


and avoids it ; or the hole in the hedge and goes through 
it ; and he crosses the flower bed with the same indiffer- - 
ence as the gravel walk. He shows no mental recogni- 
tion of the flower, weed, tree, hedge, stone, as objects 
that can be mentally differentiated. He does not see 
with his mind, or with a mental interest, as man does. 
Bring him into his master’s library and he is mentally 
incognizant of the book, the magazine, the jug, the pipe, 
the chair, the ink-bottle, as things distinguished from 
one another physically and distinguishable mentally. 

The difference is illustrated in another way by the 
animal’s well-known habit of remaining motionless, 
‘freezing’ as it is called, to escape the notice of other 
animals that are within seeing distance. I stood motion- 
less once in a quite open space for at least five minutes 
within twenty yards of a fox that was hunting for mice 
in a rotted log. There were a few stumps in the 
vicinity, and three times he looked at me as if curious 
about my identity, and e\ entually trotted off in a quite^ 
unconcerned manner. I should have had no difficulty 
in identifying the fox had he been stock-still. That the 
difference between the two minds does exist is obvious 
from the facts of language and from other evidence 
similar to the instance cited here. The real difficulty 
is in getting the difference set out clearly enough by 
the mere observational method to lift it above 
ambiguity. To do this I shall approach the question 
presently by another method. ^ 

There is, however, another interesting and, as I 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


think, legitimate comparison that might help us for- 
ward a step towards cleamfess in conceiving the fact 
of language. The articulately differentiated sounds of 
human speech stand to undifferentiated natural sounds 
in much the same relation as the explicitly differen- 
tiated bodies of the various animals stand to the undif- 
ferentiated common matter of the earth out of which 
the various animals’ bodies have been made. All 
names of animals have been fashioned by man out of 
the common element of sound, just as all animals them- 
selves have been fashioned by nature out of the common 
elements of matter. In the pre-animal stage of the 
world these common elements of matter were un- 
differentiated and formless. With the emergence 
of animal life individualized portions of matter took 
on various specific shapes and features that stand out 
sharply differentiated from one another in the various 
animals’ bodies. So with language. In the pre-language 
stage of the world the natural sounds from which 
language was to be made were undifferentiated, or at 
most vaguely differentiated. When shaped and con- 
ventionalized by men into the names of animals these 
sound-names stand out as clear and distinct from one 
another as do the animals which they name. The world- 
force first differentiated common matter into distin- 
guishable individual forms, plants, animals, birds, etc., 
and in this way added a new story to its life. Similarly 
the same ^.*;js$5f-force (whatever that force may be) 
working consciously in the mind of man has differen- 

116 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 

tiated natural sounds into distinguishable individual 
names for these plants, animals, birds, etc., and in this 
way has again added a new story to world-life. The 
inconscious organized and multiform world of matter 
has now a duplicate in the conscious organized and 
multiform world of mind by means of language symbols. 
If the world is the veritable unity which we assert it to 
be, then the fabric of human language which now ex- 
tends over the world of nature is as distinct a cycle in 
its evolution as is the cycle of animal life which extends 
over the surface of insentient nature. This will be 
made clearer a little farther on. 


2. Earth and Birds 

To most of us, a bird ’s a feathered song 
Which for our pleasure gives a voice to spring. 

We make a symbol of its airy wing 
Bright with the liberty for which we long. 

Or we discover them with love more strong 
As each a separate individual thing * 

Which only learns to act or move, or sing 
In ways tha£ wholly to itself belong. 

But some with deeper and more inward sight 
See them a part of that one Life which streams 
Slow on, towards more mind — a part more light 
Than we; unburdened with regrets, or dreams, 

Or thought. A winged emotion of the sky, 

The birds through an eternal Present fly. 

Julian Huxley, 1934. 

Before passing on to the next step, the^lfte-of man, 

117 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


I should like to say a few things more about the relation 
between animate life and the earth beneath it, that are 
implied in the conception of the organic unity of the 
world. The unity between the plant life and the in- 
organic matter of the world is apparent to the senses 
as well as to the mind. The tree is rooted in the earth, 
and we can see it with our eyes as an obvious out- 
growth of the inorganic world in which its roots remain 
bedded. But when we come to the animate world, 
the birds, for example, our senses tend to deceive us. 
The robin with its body freed from the earth appears 
to the sight as something moving upon or above the 
earth’s surface, rather than as an outgrowth or projec- 
tion of the earth. Yet the robin, when we consider 
it, is obviously a projection of the earth in the same 
literal sense as is the tree, and is also, like the tree, an 
expression of an aspect of the general world-life, one 
step in advance of the tree in the general evolution 
towards freedom. And there was a time in the his- 
&lt;ory of the world, no doubt, when the robin’s 
remote ancestors were not detached from the physical 
environment out of which they were emerging; 
and a point or period of time when that detachment 
was effected, and the great step made towards free- 
dom. How the step was made is a question for the 
naturalist. 

Similarly, when we listen to the various songs of the 
birds around us^ we are apt to think of these as mere 
the voices' of isolated birds upon the surface of a 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 

material world. But here again if our theory of the 
organic nature of the world corresponds in verity to 
the actual nature of the world — and all our thinking 
leads us more and more to that view — then these voices 
of the birds are the voices of the world breaking through 
these individualized living forms which the world, in 
the creative evolution or unfolding of its life and mind, 
has by long processes produced and developed for that 
particular kind of utterance. In other words, the ( 
voices of the birds are the individualized and localized 
voices of the world ; and the living impulses of joy that 
emanate in the bird’s songs are the joy impulses of the 
world, as Plato pointed out long ago in The Laws. These 
songs and cries are the recently inchoate life and mind 
of the world emerged now into voice and expression 
through individualized organic bodies. What other 
ultimate interpretation can be given them? All recent 
scientific and philosophic thought, and the no less 
authoritative intuitive thought of poetry, when carried^ 
through to the end, lead us to this view. It is inter- 
esting to think , t under the conception 1 of emergent 
evolution, of the many steps and long history that lie 
between the original huge, formless, voiceless matter 
of the world in its pre-life period, and the tiny, in- 
dividualized, liberated, animated piece of matter that 
mounts in the skylark’s body and gives its portion of the 
world’s life back to the world in song. This would 
be a typical example of the manner in ^i..'ch 4 the world 
rises to its actual life and voice. The skylark, if it 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


could speak, might well say, like Caliban’s pipe in 
Browning’s poem: 

I make the cry my maker cannot make e 

With his great r ound mouth ; he must blow through 
mine! 


If it should be objected by the modem realist that 
the above world-view is a rather outmoded idealism 
at the present time, 1 would agree ; with the rejoinder, 
however, that the view has persisted through many 
alternating fashions of philosophic thought from pre- 
Platonic to post-Hegelian times, and is likely to survive 
in modified form the present anti-idealistic mode 
of thought. The idealism (the word is entirely mis- 
leading to most modems) of Hegel, for example, is not 
wanting in realistic content, witness his philosophy of 
history and of art, as the detractors of Hegel would 
find if they took the trouble to read his work, though 
he does rather ruthlessly crush the factual material in 
order to extract its significance. If it should be further 
objected that the language employed in presenting the 
view is the diction and phraseology of poetry rather 
than of sober science, the answer would be that these 
higher aspects of the world which we call life and mind 
are the aspects with which poetry is especially con- 
cerned, and that many of these aspects are so subtle, 
elusive, and fugitive in their nature that they cannot be 
caught or accurately conveyed by any diction less subtle, 
fluid, and zps&amp;t %ie than the diction of poetry. And for 
readers who have made no close study of the exactness 

no 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 

of poetry in dealing with its own particular phase of the 
truth of the world it may be worth while recalling 
Coleridge’s observatiorf ‘that poetry has a logic of its 
own as severe as that of science, and more difficult, 
because more subtle, more complex, and dependent 
upon more fugitive causes.’ 

The Canadian poet, Bliss Carman, in one of his 
poems, The Choristers, has given a rather striking poetic 
expression of the emergence of life and purposive sound 
in the world. He follows Plato, whether consciously ' 
or not, in conceiving mind (God) as an original element 
and the guiding agency in world evolution, and love 
and gladness as active and creative principles which in 
their strain and urge for expression eventually produced 
those tiny animated pieces of matter, the birds, with 
their throats fashioned for song. Carman has used a 
very simple and naive diction, some of it, like ‘seraphs’ 
chorus,’ quite archaic in comparison with modem scien- 
tific diction, but in spite of this he has succeeded in 
conveying in a rather telling way the whole idea of the * 
organic unity of die world of matter-and-mind as it 
emerges from lifeless to living activity. 

When earth &gt;vas finished and fashioned well 
There was never a musical note to tell 
How glad God was, save the voice of the rain 
And the sea and wind on the lonely plain 
And the rivers among the hills. 

And so God made the marvellous birds 
For a choir of joy transcending wordS^ . 


Hi 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


He filled their tiny bodies with fire, 

He taught them love for their chief desire, 


And to each he apportioned a fragment of song — 

• Those broken melodies that belong 
To the seraphs’ chorus. . . . 

( So music dwells in the glorious throats 
Forever, and the enchanted notes 
Fall with rapture upon our ears, 

Moving our hearts to joy and tears 
For things we cannot say. 

The fact that we, the conscious recipients of these 
world- voices, are so deeply and variously moved 
by them, is itself the strongest kind of presumptive 
evidence of a causal connection, other than merely 
physical, between man’s mind and the world-cycles oi 
life beneath it, and also of some kind of vital purposive- 
ness throughout the rising cycles of nature from matter 
to man. 

This whole view is, of course, based upon the organic 
hypothesis described above, of a purposive activity in 
the world which was working towards the making, say, of 
birds before it had actually made them. When the 
stage was prepared and set this same purposive activity 
made the birds so that they could fly and sing. The 
length of time involved in the making, whether a thou- 
sand or a million years, does not affect the theory. 

One cau^st^ no way of concretely imaging or de 
scribing this prime purposive agency, or its mode of 

122 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 

working in the world, since, in fashioning the bird’s 
body, it works apparently from within matter ; while all 
purposive activity, which we can observe in operation 
now, whether in animal or in human life, imposes its 
purpose upon matter from without. I accept the pur- 
posive hypothesis because it appears the only logical 
one. If the parts of the bird’s body were not pur- 
posively combined into a purposive organism, then they 
must have come together by chance. I have tried to 
think how particles of inorganic matter might by chance 
have formed themselves, in a million years, into the 
bones, muscles, digestive and respiratory organs, blood, 
flesh, skin, eyes, feathers, wings, etc., of a bird, all the 
parts co-ordinated and unified with the vital principle 
of life, and I find it absolutely impossible to imagine 
how it could so happen at all, any more than I can 
imagine particles of matter ‘shooting out in millions of 
directions for millions of years,’ if you like, forming 
themselves into a locomotive with the power of pulling 
a train of cars. • &lt; 

But this analogy, the reader may object, between the 
bird and the locoihotive is going back again to Paley’s 
analogy of the watch. Partly, yes. But Paley’s error 
was not in his idea of design, or purposive activity in 
itself, but in his anthropomorphic conception of it. He 
conceived the prime creative activity as standing outside 
the matter of the world, and making purposive living 
things in much the same way as a man wakes a watch. 
The analogy, drawn in this fashion, will not fibid* The 

,J 3 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


bird is a living piece of matter; the watch lifeless. The 
bird seeks its own daily food, propagates its species, 
etc. ; the watch has to be wound by man and when worn 
out has to be replaced by a man-made new one. The 
purposiveness of the watch — to mark the time — is im- 
posed upon lifeless matter from without by external 
design; the purposiveness of the bird — to sing, fly, 
propagate, etc. — is infused into matter from within, by 
internal design. How so infused one sees no way of 
conceiving in detail at all. One merely deduces the 
inherence of a purposive activity in the world from the 
purposive nature of its products — animate nature and 
man. In man the purposive activity of the world comes 
out to complete explicitness. The entire world of art, 
for example, both of use and beauty, which is now 
spread over the world of nature on this planet is the 
product of explicit purpose working through the brain 
and hand of man, who is nature’s chief product. To 
conceive an unbroken unity in the world one seems 
' forced to carry the purposive activity backward down 
the scale of existence from the highest form, man, to 
its lowest form, matter. 

But why, one might here ask, do I not at once call 
this prime vital activity in the world * God, ’ instead of 
using only vague descriptive words that appear to be 
evading the issue ? Because that would be going farther 
in the direction of definiteness than the formulated con- 
ception of th saorganic hypothesis would warrant. The 
word - God’ connotes in the minds of most people an 

12 + 



ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPRESSION 

anthropomorphic agency, a limited personality who 
works towards limited particular ends, in a manner 
very similar to that in which human beings work. But 
whatever one’s belief may be, there seems to be no way 
of knowing or conceiving the central creative force of the 
world in this definite way. The anthropomorphic con- 
ception of purpose is the highest form we know in the 
cycles of reality, and there is as yet no way of definitely 
conceiving a higher form of purposive agency who could 
produce purposive animated pieces of matter — birds, 
animals, etc. — which would be even remotely analo- 
gous to the purpose-serving inanimate machines which 
man can make. Since the whole hypothesis can be 
conceived only in a general way the diction and 
phraseology in which it is set out cannot legitimately 
be more definite than the conception in the mind.

CHAPTER VI 


MAN AND THE ANIMALS 

Every animal has its sphere to which it belongs by birth, into 
, which it instantly enters, in which it continues all through life, 
and in which it dies. . . . The spider weaves with as much skill 
as did Minerva, but all its skill is restricted to this narrow sphere ; 
this is its universe. How marvellous is the insect and how narrow 
the sphere of its activity. — Herder, Origin of Language, 1772. 

In the preceding pages we have given a descriptive out- 
line of the Space-Time picture of the life and mind of 
the world as it has emerged by successive steps towards 
freedom and individuality, up to and including animal 
life and intelligence. But there is as yet no language; 
and, from all that we can discover, no power nor prob- 
lem in the animal nature which would bring language 
into existence. There seems to be some barrier that 
holds the animal’s mind back from that realm of free 
mind into which man has entered, where language first 
emerges. What is the barrier? Can it be intellec- 
tually grasped and described? These are the two 
questions. 

Darwin, as we have seen, held that there was no 
barrier; tlast tlie difference was merely ‘a difference in 
degree of mental development.’ While this statement, 

126 



MAN AND THE ANIMALS 


as we have also seen, gives us no specific light on the 
problem at its present stage, it had a value in its time, 
and has been considered adequate by most biologists 
and general readers since Darwin’s time, who have 
made no close study of language. His followers, to 
illustrate the view, have frequently made the statement 
that the difference in mental development between the 
lowest type of savage, the Fuegian, for example, and a 
fully civilized and cultivated man is greater than the 
difference between the same savage and the anthropoid 
ape. Recently I came across the following illustration, 
used to symbolize the relative differences. 

CIVILIZED MAN 

FUEGIAN | 

CHIMPANZEE 


Fig. 2 

But both the statement and the illustration are clearly 
erroneous, owing to the confusion of resemblance of 
power with identity of power. The error can be made 
very clear by an example. 

If we were to take a six -month-old Fuegian infant 
and place him in an educated English-speaking home in 
Canada with its common educational ^opportunities, 
what and where would he be in twenty yea A? He 

127 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


would be first of all in complete working possession of 
a highly developed language, the instrument by which 
man has elaborated the world of mind into which he has 
entered and in which he realizes his characteristic des- 
tiny. Then, by means of this language, he would have 
elaborated concretely for himself the various parts of 
this mental world, in history, geography, literature, 
mathematics, science, and would stand in much the 
same position as any Canadian boy who had a long 
line of civilized ancestors. The seeming gulf between 
the savage and the civilized man would be practically 
bridged in a quarter of a single life-span. 

Now put the chimpanzee’s six-month-old offspring in 
the same home and environment, and at twenty years 
he would know none of these things. He is excluded 
by some impassable barrier from man’s mental world, 
the world which man has actualized and elaborated by 
means of language. Darwin expresses surprise that 
some men should still think that there is any such 
barrier between the two. ‘Nevertheless,’ he writes, 
‘many authors have insisted that man is divided by an 
insuperable barrier from the lower animals in his mental 
faculties.’ Well, these authors, as a matter of demon- 
strable fact, are right and Darwin wrong. The Fuegian 
is at the outset already across the barrier that stands 
between nature and free mind, and moves forward in 
that new world of free mind immediately opportunity 
is given . Th e-echimpanzee is still in the world of nature, 
and is blocked, as yet at least, by the barrier that stands 



MAN AND THE ANIMALS 


between nature and free mind, whether we can ever 
explicitly describe that barrier or not. The savage is, 
as it were, just across the barrier into the new world, 
while the civilized man has gone a great way inland, so 
that the savage in his outward appearance more closely 
resembles his nearest of kin in the old world which he 
has just left than he does his actual brother who has 
gone so far ahead of him in the new world. But what- 
ever resemblances there may be in mental faculty between 
the chimpanzee and the savage, it is clearly a resemblance ' 
merely and not an identity of power. 

That Darwin and his followers should have fallen into 
and persisted in this now obvious confusion regarding 
the respective mental powers of the animals and man is 
a striking illustration of how even the most careful 
scientist may fall a prey to unscientific prejudices against 
old forms of thought and their mode of expression ; and 
how these prejudices, coupled with his desire for com- 
plete coherence in the new thought which he is elabora- 
ting, may blind him to significant facts in the old quitd^ 
as completely as any popular or theological prejudice 
can blind its adherents to the truth of the new. When, 
for example, the old writer on the Genesis of life in 
the world represented man’s fall (or awakening) from 
innocence as resulting from his eating of a forbidden 
fruit, and the consequent opening of his eyes to a know- 
ledge of good and evil, truth and error, etc., leading in 
turn to his expulsion from the Gardeft of Eden (the 
world of nature, in modern colourless phraseology ), 

129 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


and his giving names to the things in the natural world, 
he gave one of the most memorable accounts that will 
ever be given of one of the most momentous facts in the 
story of emergent evolution of life and mind in the 
world. When the novelty of recent discoveries has 
worn off a little, and the mind of the modem world, 
settled into something of a sober perspective again, 
returns with a more flexible intelligence to a reading 
of that old story, it will perhaps wonder that an allegory 
which so vividly images forth a cardinal fact in world 
history should have fallen into even temporary disre- 
pute through the obloquy thrown upon it by the preju- 
dice of novel discoveries, however important these 
discoveries themselves may turn out to be. Every new 
truth, however, must at first make its way against the 
jealous prejudices of the old, and by the very spirit of 
aggression necessary to expel the old the new truth is 
apt to develop its own prejudice in the manner of a 
defensive armour. It requires only a little heat in the 
'mind to smudge the features of the fairest truth with 
its affined prejudice.

CHAPTER VII 

THE BARRIER OF SPACE AND TIME 

Space and Time as infinite and all-embracing wholes are a 
priori intuitions which are the condition of and antecedent to all ' 
our knowledge of particular objects in space and time, — Kant, 
Critique of Pure Reason, 1781, 

What, then, is the barrier between the animals and 
man, that excludes the animals from man’s mental 
world? It is the barrier primarily of Space and Time. 
This, I think, can be made clear. 

First, consider Time. It is clear, to begin with, 
that the dog holds in his memory, at least in some dim 
way, the time-span, or the time experiences, within 
the physical duration of his own life. The dog will go 
to-day where he found food yesterday. Darwin’s dog 
recognized him after an absence of five years and twit- 
days. Odysseus’s dog, Argus, according to Homer, 
recognized his master, even through his beggar’s dis- 
guise, after an absence of twenty years. There is no 
doubt that the dog has memory of this kind, which 
shows that he has sojne grasp of time within his own 
life-span. Whether it is conscious memory with an 
explicit measurement of a stretch of time between a 
point in past time and the present mdhient, as is the 
case with man’s memory, is extremely douUtful. It 

131 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


seems to be rather a recognition of the master’s iden- 
tity, or sameness, through a succession of experiences, 
each of which is for the dog a present experience with- 
out any explicit differentiation of time into past and 
present. 

&gt; Because — and this is the vital point — while it is clear 

that the dog has some kind of memory, and hence some 
grasp of time within his own physical life-span, it is 
! equally clear, so far as can be discovered, that the dog 
| has no sense of time prior to his own birth or subse- 
i quent to his own death. He has no sense or conscious- 
ness of any dog’s life of a hundred years ago. He could 
not be awakened to any consciousness of or interest in 
the story of Darwin’s dog, nor could Darwin’s dog have 
been awakened to an interest in the dog of Odysseus. 
The time before and after his own actual life-span is as 
completely hidden from him as the past and future were 
hidden from the passengers over Mirza’s bridge by the 
impenetrable mists that hung at either end. His mind 
" is enveloped and confined by time within the short span 
of his own physical life. 

Man’s mind, on the other hand, though centred in a 
material body like the dog’s, has broken through this 
envelope or sense-barrier of time, and holds all time 
now in its grasp instead of being held by it. It has 
no more difficulty in holding Homer’s story of three 
thousand years ago than Darwin’s of a hundred years 
ago, and ^explicitly differentiates the stretch of time 
betwee'h'the two events. To all this past time the dog’s 

13* 



J

THE BARRIER OF SPACE AND TIME 


mind is stone-dead. To object that the dog has no 
langiiage for the differentiation of time into explicit 
parts is to reverse the true logic, because language is 
just the instrument created by man to actualize and 
elaborate his new world of Free Mind into which he 
had emerged, and of which time is one of the forms; 
and the dog whose mind is unfreed and still encom- 
passed in time has no such time-world of mind to 
elaborate, and hence no language or need of language. 

In other words man’s mind has broken through the ' 
sense - limiting medium of time, has encompassed 
time in its grasp, and now holds all time in its single 
view as the potential form in which to build up and 
arrange a mental world of succession and development. 
Language is the system of symbols created to elaborate J 
this new world. 

The same difference is true of Space. The dog has 
some kind of mental knowledge of that local portion of 
space in which his body moves about, the space which 
lies within the range of his senses and experience, buC 
he never breaks through the circle of that limited range 
to the grasp of space as a whole. While he remains in 
Vancouver his mind cannot be awakened to any sense 
or consciousness of a dog show in Montreal, three- 
thousand-odd miles a^yay. His mind, though radiating 
to a certain circumference beyond his body, is never- 
theless enclosed, like his body, within a local space as 
we found it enclosed within a local ^ime. To the 
dog’s master, on the other hand, the dog shoW three

THE NEW INVESTIGATION 

thousand miles away is as mentally present while he reads 
of it on the news page of his evening paper as the dog 
show two blocks away in his own town, which he reads 
of also on the same page. Distance or nearness in 
actual space makes no difference mentally at all, since 
all points are merely differentiations of a single space 
which he holds within his mind as an always-present 
mental world. 

It is true that man never actually perceives space and 
time in their entirety with his senses. The range of 
his physical sight has apparently the same physical limi- 
tations as the range of the animal’s. But his mental 
differentiation of objects within his local space- time 
environment is so complete and explicit that the mind 
has no difficulty in visualizing limitless stretches of 
space and time beyond the range of the senses. A 
small map of the world’s surface, for example, of a 
single square foot in dimension, which he looks at with 
his eyes, is only a miniature material picture of the 
'mental picture which he visualizes in his mind, and 
whose actual physical dimensions extend to thousands 
of square miles, far beyond the range of his senses. 

This is the unique characteristic of the human mind. 
In each isolated piece of matter of some two and three- 
quarter cubic feet and one hundred and seventy-five 
pounds avoirdupois, which makes up a man’s body, 
there is centred a power which radiates to the farthest 
boundaries of Space and time. Even the behaviourist 
who attempts to explain all actions of the mind on a 

«34 



) 

THE BARR1FR OF SPACE AND TIME 

w* 

physical basis of stimulus and response will admit this. 
(See J. B. Watson, Behaviorism , 1930, Chap. X on 
‘Talking and Thinking.’) 

It is very probable, though one sees no way as yet of 
actually demonstrating it, that the animal’s mental in- 
ability to differentiate objects explicitly within his local 
environment, which we have referred to above, is due 
to the fact that his mind does not hold space and time 
explicitly within its grasp as does man’s mind. Kant 
held, and in fact made it quite clear, that man’s mental ■ 
possession of space and time as wholes preceded the 
explicit differentiation of local objects in a limited 
portion of space and time, and so, in the Transcendental 
Aesthetic he enunciated the doctrine that space and time 
are forms of the mind, and not external to it, as they 
appear to the senses to be. This was perhaps his most 
significant original contribution to the whole problem 
of mind, though, as pointed out in the beginning, we 
have not yet made full use of it. 

This sense and grasp of space and time as wholes^, 
with the consequent explicit differentiation of objects 
within any local portion of space and time, is perhaps 
the significant part of the concrete definition of con- 
sciousness in man as distinguished from the inconscious 
mind of animals. The clearest single statement I know 
of this difference codies from Browning. In his dis- 
cussion of the problem of human happiness in Cleon, he 
has, in a memorable passage of twenty-eight lines, made 
one of the most determined and successful attempts to 

&gt;3 5 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


set out clearly the nature of this special quality or power 
in the human mind which distinguishes man from the 
animals. Though written in verse it is expressed with 
unique precision, and is intended to be read with the 
same literalness as the most exact scientific prose. The 
passage is supposedly written by a Greek philosopher- 
poet, Cleon, in a letter to his king and patron, Protus. 
If, in the morning of philosophy, 

Ere aught had been recorded, nay perceived. 

Thou, with the light now in thee, couldst have looked 
On all earth’s tenantry, from worm to bird, 

Ere man, her last, appeared upon the stage — • 

Thou wouldst have seen them perfect, and deduced 
The perfectness of others yet unseen. 

Conceding which — had Zeus then questioned thee 
‘Shall I go on a step, improve on this, 

Do more for visible creatures than is done?’ 

Thou wouldst have answered, ‘Ay, by making each 
Grow conscious in himself — by that alone. 

All 's perfect else: the shell sucks fast the rock. 

The fish strikes through the sea, die snake both swims 
And slides, forth range the beasts, the birds take flight, 

— Till life’s mechanics can no further go — 

And all this joy in natural life is put 
Like fire from off thy finger into each. 

So exquisitely perfect is the same. 

But ’tis pure fire, and they mere matter are: 

It has them, not they it ; and so l choose 
For man, thy last premeditated work 
(If 1 might add a glory to the schem , 

That a third thing should stand apart Jrom both, 

A quality arise within his soul. 

Which, intro-active, made to supervise 
And feel the force it has, may view itself. 

And so be happy.’ 

136

THE BARRIER OF SPACE AND TIME 


It would be difficult to make a clearer or more precise 
statement in prose of the difference in mental fact between 
the animals and man, though Browning has stated the 
difference in relation to conduct and happiness while we 
are investigating the difference in relation to knowledge. 

Following out our argument from the point of view 
of space and time, let us attempt to put the significant 
difference between the two into a concise statement. 
The animal’s mind, like his body, is held within the 
sense limits of space and time; but man’s mind, though • 
focused in the body, has broken completely through 
both these forms and now holds both time and space 
within itself. Or more succinctly still, time-and- 
space holds the animal’s mind; man’s mind holds time- 
and-space. The difference is fundamental, and, in the 
things that follow from it, is as significant as any differ- 
ence we know in the scale of emergent organic life in 
the world. The whole point made here is only, as 
already pointed out, the logical extension and concrete 
application of Kant’s view in the Transcendental Aesthetic 
of Pure Reason where he showed that space and time 
are forms of the mind and not external to it, though 
Kant might not hold his doctrine responsible for all 
that seems to me to follow from it. It would all be 
implied, however, in^ Hegel’s development of Kant’s 
doctrine, if I do not misunderstand Hegel. 

This rising above space and time, and enclosing 
them within his own ubiquitous and omnipresent self, 

‘a universal here and now,’ seems to be tbfi basic 

•37

THE NEW INVESTIGATION 

difference between man and the animals in their mental 
powers, when considered in their objective charac- 
teristics and behaviour. Other differences follow 
naturally upon this one, since time and space are the 
forms within which the whole world is constructed. 
While a man, for example, sits within the walls of his 
own study, 14 ft. by 12 ft. by 1 o ft. in its actual physical 
dimensions, and goes over the world-news page of his 
daily paper, he reads one item from England, another 
from Greece, another from Russia, another from Japan, 
another from his own town; one item from to-day, 
another of five years ago, another of five hundred years 
ago, another of five thousand; but these various items, 
scattered through leagues and years of actual space and 
time, are all equally present, and within his mental 
possession, while his body sits at home here and now in 
his own study. All these differentiated items which 1 
are obviously outside his own body in space and time 
are just as obviously — when we think closely about it 
- — and in the same literal sense within his mind. When, 
for example, we make distinction in time, say between 
4$o b.c. and a.d. 450, we are making distinctions 
within the mind, not outside of it. That is, the mind, 
though focused and centred in a body in this present 
time and space, holds all time and space within itself. 
It is itself in a quite literal sedse co-terminous with 
space and time. When the poet wrote: 

Backward, J * turn backward, O Time, in thy flight, 

Nfeke me a child again just for to-night, 

138 



THE BARRIER OF SPACE AND TIME 


he could not have expressed the longing for the physical 
return of childhood did he not hold in his mind as a 
present possession the mental counterpart of it. It is 
the contrast between the mental presence of the past 
time and the absence of its physical counterpart that 
makes the point in the song. 

It is difficult to realize actually this limitless range of 
the human mind because the evidence from our senses 
is all against it. We see our bodies and the bodies of 
one another as local objects like any other objects con- 
fined always to a particular time and space, and to say 
that the mind, which comes to a focus of consciousness 
in this same body, is not so confined but free of both 
time and space, or rather holds time and space within 
itself, sounds like a fine flourish of rhetoric rather than 
a plain statement of fact. Fact it is, nevertheless; the 
fact which separates man from his animal relatives, and 
which necessitates articulate language for man while 
the animals remain without it. Whether we call this 
a difference of degree or kind is a matter of agreement* 
on the connotations of terms. The two words, how- 
ever, as already pointed out, have served their day and 
their inherent vagueness renders them quite useless in 
any precise modern discussion of the subject.

CHAPTER VIII 


MAN 

The termination of the world in a man appears to be the last 
victory of intelligence. . . . The great Pan of old, who was clothed 
* in a leopard-skin to signify the beautiful variety of things, and the 
firmament, his coat of stars — was but the representative of thee, 
O rich and various Man! thou palace of sight and sound, carrying 
in thy senses the morning and the night and the unfathomable 
galaxy; in thy brain, the geometry of the City of God; in thy 
heart, the bower of love and the realms of right and wrong. An 
individual man is a fruit which it cost all the foregoing ages to 
form and ripen. . . . Each individual soul is such, in virtue of 
its being a power to translate the world into some particular 
language of its own. — Emerson, The Method of Nature. 

i. The Emergence of Consciousness 

If we now relate this unique characteristic of man in a 
definite and explicit way with the general Time-and- 
Space picture which we have been drawing, we shall 
see plainly the full significance of this last step — where 
mind in man emerges to freedom from space and time, 
and encompasses diem in its gmsp — in the unfolding 
life and mind of the world. 

Recall again our working hypothesis, the organic 
unity of the world from matter to man. For aeons, if 
science speaks truly, our earth, to human perception 

140 



MAN 


at least, stood stark and naked, a .mineral mass. In the 
process of time this seeming mineral mass clothed itself 
in life, in sensitivity, in mind. These later emergents, 
if the world is, as science asserts, an organic whole, 
are not adventitious decorations like tinsel on a Christ- 
mas tree, nor alien visitants extraneous to reality. They 
are the children of the earth who owe to her creating 
and shaping energy their multivarious forms and powers, 
physical and mental, and derive from her directly 
and indirectly their hourly nourishment, all without 
design on their own part. Life and mind which 
have emerged to explicit activity in these later cycles 
of world evolution must have been present as latent 
potentialities when the earth seemed but a mineral 
mass; and purpose, which is the explicit directing 
agency in all man’s activity, must have been, as it seems 
to us, the prime directing agency of the whole evolu- 
tionary process, though emerging to explicitness first 
in animal nature, especially man. How otherwise, for 
example, could the human organism, when the hoilt 
for its awakening into consciousness came, find all its 
numerous and minutest parts so finely co-ordinated and 
articulated into a purposive agent for explicit design 
and execution? 

We deduce the purposiveness of the entire evolu- 
tionary process from* base to peak from the fact that 
purposiveness explicitly emerges to view at the peak, 
and all the earlier or lower stages seeih to be adapted 
in an anticipatory way to produce these purposive 

H 1 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


agents at the top and to co-ordinate their inward and 
outward environment with a view to their successful 
purposive activities. If this hypothesis be right, then 
the purposive shaping principle at work in the world 
seems to have worked for an indefinite period of its 
history in an embryonic fashion from within, in the 
dark as it were, among the sensuous materials of the 
world, fashioning and moulding these materials into the 
forms necessary for the actualization of its own emer- 
ging life, but all the while mute and unconscious of 
the process. First, the many differentiated inorganic 
structures, then upward into the organic world through 
an ascending series of insentient and sentient life, rising 
in each step to a higher freedom and a more self-con- 
tained individuality. Then, as a last and crowning step, 
— so far at least as the earth goes at the present time — 
this purposive shaping principle produces the adequate 
individual organism man, by means of which she 
emerges above the sense media of space and time, en- 
compasses and holds these within her view, awakens to 
freedom and consciousness and, turning back, as it 
were, upon herself, is confronted with the endlessly 
diversified forms of all her own preconscious evolution. 
Man is nature at the highest point of her activity ; and 
when we speak, in our ordinary clualistic way, of man 
investigating nature in knowledge, we mean, if we are 
thinking philosophically at all, that nature, emerging 
into self-consciWusness at her apex in man, is now busy 
exploring from that peak the lower cycles of her own 

142 



MAN 


nature. We can visualize the whole picture more 
clearly, perhaps, through a simple symbolic diagram 
than through a written description. 

Let the circle A represent the actualized world up 
to that point where reason emerges to consciousness 
in man, and the three 
zones represent the cycles 
of inorganic, plant, and 
animal life, respectively. 

Let the vertical lines 
represent the successive 
generations of plant and B 
animal life as they pass 
through the world, and the 
rising line BC represent Ro 

the general evolutionary 

time-line of man’s life in the world up to the point C 
where he emerges to consciousness. Previous to the 
point C in the evolution time-line the world was a 
single space-time world whose individualized forma 
were differentiated and distributed in space, and moved 
forward as an ever-vanishing series in time. All its 
objects were encompassed in space and enveloped in 
time. The generation of animals which were alive, 
for example, between lines io and n had no sense of 
time previous to io, hor subsequent to 1 1, as we have 
already shown. 

But at the point C where man emerged to conscious- 
ness the mind of the world, centred now in the human 

«43 




THE NEW INVESTIGATION 

organism, broke through the enveloping mediums of 
both space and time, and encompassed these within 
itself so as to hold the whole world of space and time 
within its single view. This new expansion can be 
made very clear by a further illustration. If we take 
our circle again, and remember the rising line BC 

symbolizes- the evolution- 
ary time-line of man’s 
ancestry, up to the point 
C, where world conscious- 
ness emerges in man, then 
this emergence to con- 
sciousness where the 
world turns back upon 
itself and encompasses 
itself in a single view 
(unactualized, of course, 
at this point, but real) 
would be accurately symbolized by the lighter lines 
radiating from C backwards, C-d, C-e, C-f, etc., 
over the whole space-time world. 

Now we have in a quite literal sense two worlds 
of space and time; the actual space-time world of 
material nature represented by the horizontal and ver- 
tical lines, and the ideal space-time world of mind 
represented by the lines radiating butward from C ; and 
the two worlds are co-terminous. 



&gt;44 



MAN 


2. A Duplicate World 

Soon the human has a verbal substitute within himself theo- 
retically for every object in the world. Thereafter he carries the 
world around with him by means of this organization. And he can 
manipulate this world in the privacy of his room or when he lies 
down on his bed in the dark. — j. B. Watson, Behaviorism, revised 
edition, 1930, p, 234. 

This new mental space-time world which emerges 
at C in conscious reason is a duplicate or counterpart 
of the actual space-time world of sense, so that the 
world which was formerly a single sensuous world now 
becomes a dual world. On the one hand there is the 
material space-time world of sensuous nature already 
highly actualized in all sorts of inorganic and organic 
forms. Previous to the emergence of conscious reason 
in man this was the single and only actualized world. 
Now, on the other hand, there emerges the mental 
space-time world of conscious reason, individualized 
and focused in the brain of man, and confronted in this 
its birth hour with that other already elaborated spaffe- . 
time world of nature. This new (inward) mental 
space-time world which radiates from its centre in 
man’s physical organism stands as the awakened coun- 
terpart of the actualized natural world. This mental 
world, as I am describing it here, corresponds, as said 
above, to Kant’s exposition of space and time where 
he showed that these are forms of the mind — ‘an ideal 
space and time,’ as he called it — tlfit make possible 
our experience of objects that appear external to one 



THl BARRIER OF SPACE AND TIME 

another in space, and in succession in time. All our 
experience of the world arranges itself in these two 
media. I am assuming, however — what Kant of course 
did not assume, and what may at first appear from a 
philosophic point of view a rather naive assumption — 
that there is a real or sensuous space-time world in 
which physical objects actually exist independent of 
the perceiving mind, and which was already highly 
actualized before the birth of free and conscious mind 
with its ideal space-and-time that came into being 
with it. This ideal, non-sensuous, mental space-time 
world is, as I have said, the conscious duplicate or 
counterpart of the real, sensuous, material, ‘incon- 
scious’ space-time world of nature. 

To illustrate concretely from common experience. 
If when planning a journey I should take an ordinary 
map, eight by ten inches in size, of those parts of the 
world which I plan to visit, that map would be an ob- 
jective physical miniature of the ideal space-time world 
which I hold in my mind. Under the guidance of this 
ideal space-time world which I hold in my mind I 
would locate on the miniature physical map before me 
Algiers, Naples, Athens, Rome, Paris, London; calcu- 
late, again with the guidance of the ideal world of my 
mind, the number of actual miles of space and hours of 
time that lay between me and eada of these places in 
turn, and in this way, in half an hour of actual time, I 
should map out '•in the ideal space-time world of my 
own mind the entire journey which would afterwards 

*46 



MAN 


require two months of actual time for physical actualiza- 
tion in the actual space-time world of nature. In that 
condensed time of half an hour the journey would be 
completely visualized in the mental space- time world. 
Next morning I would set out physically to make the 
journey in the actual space-time world, and would 
travel mile by mile the five-thousand-odd miles in actual 
space in two months of actual time. The point is that 
the space-time world of mind which I traversed while 
my body sat for half an hour in a single point in actual 
space in my study, is the mental counterpart of the 
actual space-time world which I traverse afterwards in 
two months of actual time . With the birth of conscious 
reason, as stated above, a second world emerges as the 
conscious counterpart of the first, so that now we have 
a dual world. 

3. The New Troblem of Conscious Reason 

Plants are evidently for the sake of animals and animals for the 
sake of man; thus Nature, which does nothing in vain, has dcgie 
all things for the sake of man, who is the crowning end, purpose, 
or final cause towards which all has been tending. — Aristotle. 

Round his mysterious Me, there lies, under all those wool- 
rags, a Garment of Flesh (or of Senses), contextured in the Loom 
of Heaven ; whereby he is revealed to his like, and dwells with 
them in Union and Division ; and sees and fashions for himself a 

Universe, with azure Starry Spaces, and long Thousands of Years. . . 
Stands he not thereby in 3 * * * * 8 the centre of Immensities, in the conflux 
of Eternities? — Carlyle, Sartor Rcsartus, ‘Pure Reason.’ 

But man’s new mental space- time wtirld of conscious 
reason is in this its birth-hour a mere potential world 

«47 



A THE NEW INVESTIGATION ^ 


without concrete filling or content; an empty world. 
The world of sensuous nature, on the other hand, its 


outward counterpart, is already, in its own right, as 



we might put it, a highly 
differentiated and organ- 
ized world, an actual 
cosmos. The new pheno- 
menon may again be made 
visually clear by reverting 
to our former diagram. 

Letting circle A again 
represent first the actual 
world of nature, the hori-

zones of inorganic and organic forms in the world,

and the lighter lines radiating from C backwards 

148 






MAN 


marking the new space-time world of conscious mind 
as it radiates outward over the natural world as its 
conscious counterpart. Now if in imagination we 
turn this space-time world of mind off the space- 
time world of nature so that we can see it as it were 
in its own nature we shall have Fig. 6, which would 
be a fairly atcurate symbolic representation of the 
situation at the dawn of conscious reason at C. Here 
the circle A x marks the space-time world of nature 
already highly actualized; A 2 the new space-time 
world of mind just bom and entirely empty. 

The task set to man, then, on emerging into posses- 
sion of this new world of conscious mind, was to ‘intel- 
lect 1 the world, to take mental possession of it, to 
transfer its types one by one from the outward space- 
time world of nature to the inner space-time world of 
mind, and to build them up into a conscious system 
there in correspondence to this actual outward system 
in external nature. Or to restate the situation from 
the evolution point of view, in the awakened reasoif of 
man the world ^merges into a new cycle of its rising 
life, splits into two halves, an outer and an inner, passes 
from inconscious to conscious activity, and man.emerges 
as the world-bom conscious organism to bring to actu- 
alization this new cycle of world development. Or in ( 
still more vitally organic phrase, new-born man is the 
world at that point where its reason comes to a focus, 
emerges to consciousness, turns back"\ipon itself, and is 
confronted with the task of taking conscious possession

of itse4f by translating its actual physical types into their 
mental counterparts, of exploring all the steps and 
stages of its pre-conscious evolution. 

In this step, however, across the boundary from 
nature into free mind, from the sensuous world to its 
supra-sensuous counterpart, a problem rises that is new 
in the world. How can man, just come into possession 
of his new conscious world, actually get started upon 
the task to which he is called; the task of translating 
the actualized space-time world of nature into the new- 
born space- time world of mind? His consciousness 
in this its birth-hour is a mere potential, and as yet, 
quite empty world. What are the weans then, or the 
media, by which he can build up within his empty reason 
an actual and organized structure of differentiated forms, 
images, and ideas, that will reflect in that inner ideal 
world the ordered outward system of the actual world? 
That is the world-problem that emerges at this point in 
its evolution. It is an entirely new problem. There 
is no such problem for the animals in the cycle of nature 
beneath man. 



CHAPTER IX 


LANGUAGE 

Nature gives no power in vain. She not only gave to man the 
power to invent language, but made the power his specific 
characteristic and the dynamic principle of his destiny. This 
power came from her hand as a living principle. . . . Reason 
was incapable of action without a word-symbol, and the first 
moment of rationality must also have been the first beginning of 
interior language. . . . Man feels with his mind and speaks 
while he thinks; therefore, the development of language is as 
natural to man as his nature. — Herder, The Origin of Language, 
1772. 


1 . The Birth of Language 

Obviously, what man required was a system of mental 
symbols of some kind or other in the inner world* Qf 
mind, to represent the system of actual types in the o ut-_ 
ward world of sense. Each species or type of object Jul 
the outward world of nature would require its corre- 
sponding symbol in the inward world of mind. Without 
such mental symbols no articulated advance could be 
made in that proce^i which we now speak of familiarly 
as the accumulation of the knowledge of the world. The 
advance could be made only step by step, and each step 
would have to be recorded, registered, and fixed by 



' THE NEW INVESTIGATION?/ 

■u '' ' ,1 

means ,,of its symbol within the rising mental fabric. 
The discovery or creation of adequate symbols of reason, 
then, was an obvious necessity for man even to get 
definitely started at all upon the elaboration or actu- 
alization of the world of mind. 

It was out of this necessity that the articulate and 
cumulative language of man had its birth..' Language is 
just that needed system of symbols which man has 
created for the elaboration of that new space-time 
world of mind to which he was called by the ‘World- 
Spirit’ when the world emerged from the preconscious 
to the conscious cycle of its self-development. * 

Language, then, is a new phenomenon in the world, 
brought into life at that point where the reason of the 
world emerges from its inconscious state to its freed 
and conscious life. There is always a difficulty in 
coming to a mutual understanding upon the connotation 
of words ; but it becomes palpably clear when the sub- 
ject is developed in this way that to call the natural cries 
of animals language, without some specific qualification 
of the word, is a sheer confusion of all significant differ- 
ences in reality and thought. The animals, as yet at 
least, have no free space-time world of mind whose 
detailed elaboration necessitates the symbols which we 
call language, and until they have such a world they 
can have no language in any exact connotation of 
the wnrd

2. Characteristics of the New World of Langifage 

But the Intellect can raise, 

From airy words alone, a Pile that ne’er decays. 

Wordsworth, Inscription at Coleorton, 1811. 

To come to a clear and exact understanding of the 
nature of the* new symbols which were required to 
elaborate the new world of mind, it will be necessary 
to point out the significant characteristics of this new 
mental world as distinguished from the natural world.. 

(1 ) This new world of conscious mind is, first of all, 
not a mere addition or expansion of the sensuous world 
of nature. In its elaboration there is nothing added to 
the sum- total of the natural material world. 

(2) Nor is it any mere modification of the natural 

world. It involves no changes in that world. It is, 
on the contrary, a new and distinct world now come for 
the first time into actual existence, an invisible supra- 
sensuous world rising above and as a counterpart of .the 
visible sensuous world. • 

(3) The natural world is in constant process of 
change, a perpetual flux, as Heraclitus observed, a 
vanishing world whose specific forms are continuously 
passing away. The mental, or spiritual, world, on tlje 
other hand, rises with a cumulative movement into a 
fixed, non-vanishing* structure. It is St. Paul’s con- 
trast, if you like, between the visible and invisible 
worlds, the * temporal ’ and the ‘ eternal, ’ if we shift the 
contrast from the realm of conduct to the realm of 



THE NF.W INVESTIGATION^ 

knowledge. One is fleeting, the other enduring. From 
the myriad forms of nature that are continually coming 
into being and passing away, conscious reason extracts 
one by one, as we might put it, the permanent types, 
and attaches each to a permanent symbol, and in this 
way builds up in its own inward world a structure of 
images and ideas that reflects the natural world and 
approximates more and more towards a complete 
counterpart of it. History, for example, as it stands 
actualized at the present moment in books, is the ex- 
tracted and gathered-up transcript of a past, and now 
vanished, series of sense-events in time; and the non- 
sensuous, non- vanishing symbols of language have ac- 
complished the task. Language introduced the element of 
permanence into a vanishing world. A symbolic diagram 
will make the point clear, though it will only repeat in 
a visualized form what we have already said in words. 



Let five horizontal lines represent roughly five classes 
of organic life in their vanishing ^series in time; and 
an indefinite number of vertical lines mark the suc- 
cessive generations in this vanishing time-series; and 
the vertical line 1 3 represent the point where conscious 

*54 



LANGUAGE 


reason emerged in man. Then previous to the' point 
at 13 there was no consciousness of past or future 
beyond the birth and death dates of any living organism. 
The whole world could be described as a constantly 
vanishing one, whose passing generations could be truly 
represented by the clear-dividing vertical lines. An 
animal bom at 7 and dying at 8 had no outlook in timd 
on either side beyond these limits. Time confined him 
to this short interval of his own life-span. 

But with the emergence to consciousness at 13 the' 
envelope of time is penetrated before and after. Both 
time and space are now encompassed in a single view. In- 
stead of encompassing they are encompassed. A mental 
world emerges into being. Man looks abroad from 
his physical life-centre upon the objects of the natural 
world which are now encompassed in his mental view, 
differentiates them from one another, and gives to each 
natural object a mental symbol to fix it in his new 
mental world. While man in his physical life in the 
natural world continues as formerly in the vanislflng 
time series, he trjinscribes, as he passes along, type after 
type from the vanishing natural world into his mental 
world, which increases in content and dimensions, and 
does not pass away, so that this rising world can xo 
longer be represented by vertical lines dividing the 
vanishing generation from each other, but by an in- 



permanence as illustrated in Fig. 7. In this single 
diagram, then, we can see quite clearly the permanence 

ICC 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 


of the- world of mind as it rises above and in contrast 
with the vanishing world of sense. There is no such 
actualized and articulated world of mind in animal 
nature. The spiral diagram represents a new cycle 
in the evolution of the world. 


3. Required Characteristics of Language 
And books are yours 

Within whose silent chambers treasure lies 
Preserved from age to age. 

Wordsworth, The Excursion, Bookiv, 1814. 

These, then, are the significant characteristics of the 
world of free mind which man is called on to elaborate, 
and the symbols of language required for its elaboration 
must correspond to it in their nature. Hence these 
language symbols must be: 

(1) Supra-sensuous in import. I say ‘in import’ be- 
cause both sound and form, the body of oral and written 
language respectively, are made from sensuous elements. 

(2) They must be fluid and cumulative on the one 
hand, and at the same time fixed and permanent, since 
this is the double nature of the mental world. 

(3 ) They must be explicitly differentiated from one 
another, both in form and meaning, as the types of the 
world which they translate are explicitly differentiated 
from one another. 

(4) They must be representative of both space and 



LANGUAGE 


time, since they are to translate a world which is 
actualized in space and time. 

(s) They must be in a real sense, and by some means 
or other, freed from the sense limits of space and time 
as conscious mind is free. They must, in other words, 
be liberated from the vanishing nature of time, and 
from the rigid ftxity of space, since the mind holds both* 
motion and permanence, time and space, in a constant 
union. Where could such symbols be found? 


4. The Raw Material of Language 

For strangely in this so solid-seeming World, which neverthe- 
less is in continual restless flux, it is appointed that Sound, to 
appearance the most fleeting, should be the most continuing of 
all things. — Carlyle, Sartor Resartus, ‘Pause,’ 1830. 

It is obvious that the symbols for language could not be 
obtained ready-made fronj the world of nature from which 
man had just emerged, for everything here is in space and 
time and subject to all their conditions. Nor could thfey 
be found in the new world of conscious mind into which 
he had just emerged because this was as yet a mere 
potential and quite empty world. A third alternative 
remained. The raw material for the symbols had to 
be obtained from the space-and-time-bound world of 
nature since there wfcs no other source. ‘Man,’ said 
Herder, ‘cannot invent, but only find and imitate.’ 
Awakened reason, therefore, had first* to discover the 
adequate sensuous raw material for language from the 

&gt;57 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION? 

ii 

*" j 

natural world, and then had to transmute it in some 
way into free supra-sensuous symbols in correspondence 
with its own nature. The discovery of the adequate 
sensuous material in the actual space-time world of 
nature, and the transmutation of this raw material into 
the adequate supra-sensuous symbols of the newly 
emerged space-time world of mind, was the unique 
task and the unique achievement of conscious mind in 
man. It was the bridge to its new freedom, the key 
•and instrument for the elaboration of its new world. 
The awakening of conscious reason in man, and the in- 
vention of these supra-sensuous symbols in the form of 
connotative language for the actualization of its new 
life, mark, as we have said, the emergence of a new 
phenomenon in the evolution of the world. To con- 
fuse this, by our modem prejudice for some abstract 
unity of the world, with any rudimentary resemblances 
of it in the animal world, is to obscure a unique 
and fundamental difference in the ascending scale of 
existence. 

Where, then, in the sensuous woyld of nature was 
man to find the adequate raw material for language? 

In nature, multitudinous as her forms are, there are 
ojdy two fundamental generic types, corresponding 
to the two sense media, space and time. Form, or 
shape, is the natural expression dS space; sound is the 
natural and direct expression of time. On the passive 
side the eye is the receiving organ of the expressions 
of space, the ear of the expressions of time. 

i S S 



LANGUAGE 


And now tne question: Which of these two, the ■ 
space-forms of shape or the time-forms of sound, was 
to prove the natural raw material of language ? Experi- 
ence has already answered the question, so far as the ' 
fact is concerned. All tribes and all nations of men on 
the earth have made their language out of sound. What 
is left us here, then, is to discover the logical reason 
for the fact. 

Why has man universally used sound-speech address- 
ing itself to the ear rather than pictorial or gesture- 
speech addressing itself to the eye ? Darwin, in his dis- 
cussion of the question, has given a very concise sum- 
mary of the reasons put forward for this fact, (i ) While 
the hands were employed in gestural speech they could 
not be used for other necessary work. With vocal 
speech the hands are left free. (2 ) Oral speech is a more 
universal medium of communication. It can be heard 
in the dark, or on the other side of a wall, or while the 
person’s back is turned ; while sign-speech requires light 
for the eye to see, and can only be received when 'ihe 
eye is turned in that direction and no object intervenes. 
(3) Sound radiates from the speaker in every direction 
in a way that gesture-speech does not. 

There are, however, other limitations of gesture- 
speech which are more fundamental than those 
enumerated above. J If each gesture stood for an idea, 
or a word as we now have it, we should require as 
many gestures as there are ideas. Bift such a vast and 
ever-increasing multitude of distinguishable gestures or 



r THE NEW INVESTIGATION 
- !l , ); 
spatial shapes could not be made with the hands. Nor 
is there any way by which whole gestures, each repre- 
senting an idea as a word does at the present time, could 
be broken up into elements as has been done with 
written sound-speech in the alphabet. Distinguish- 
able gestures are each an unanlysable whole. The deaf- 
Inute, of course, can be taught to represent the twenty- 
six sound elements of the modem English alphabet by 
twenty-six shapings of the fingers and hands, but each 
of these sound elements is represented by a complete 
gesture, and not by the element of a gesture ; and for 
deaf-mutes we never could have thought of reducing a 
gesture language to twenty-six elements had not an 
artificial clue been given from the twenty-six already 
differentiated elements of sound - language. (I am 
arbitrarily using the number twenty-six merely because 
that is the number of letters in our own English alpha- 
bet.) Even when we have devised a gesture language 
of twenty-six elements by twenty-six finger and hand 
formations, each word in conversation has to be spelled 
out by the separate letter-gestures, if 4 we use alphabetic 
elements, while in oral speech we have to utter only 
single synthetic sounds where each sound includes an 
indefinite number of alphabetical elements, as, for 
example, in the word ‘crash,’ where the whole syn- 
thetic sound ‘crash’ can be uttered as easily and in 
practically as short a time as can any one of its five 
separate alphabetic elements. 

The sound-speech, on the other hand, was capable of 

160 



LANGUAGE 


being broken up into elements because of the original 
nature of the vocal organs. These organs were shaped 
so as to produce, first of ail, say, five distinguishable 
basic tones, a, e, i, o, u (I am using the arbitrary number 
jive because that is the number of our actual written 
vowel-symbols in English), and then to modify these 
tones in twenty-one distinguishable ways in their be* 
ginning, or ending, or sometimes in their continuance, 
by the lips, tongue, teeth, and nose, as represented now 
by the consonants b, c, d, f, g, etc. Now each one of 
these distinguishable tones, as also the distinguishable 
modifications in their beginnings, continuance, or end- 
ings, were separable within the composite word-sound, 
as, for example, b-a-d, though in oral speech we do not 
explicitly separate them. The enormous advantage of 
this analysis into elements for the purpose of converting 
sound-speech into visual speech is apparent at once, 
since the whole thing can be done by twenty-six spatial 
symbols. From the nature of the hands no such simpli- 
fication of gesture-speech would have been possible. 
In fact, it is quite impossible to think of any way in 
which anything like a sufficient number of distinguish- 
able gestures could have been made tp satisfy the re- J1 
quirements of language at all, had not vocal language 
gjlven us the key to the method. 

But all these, important as they may be, are from a 
logical point of view secondary reasons why sound was 
chosen rather than gestures as the substance of human 
speech. The primary logical reason for the use of 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 

sound the material of speech is that the process of 
translating the world from nature into mind is a time 
process, it all passes through the logic of thinking; and 
sound being the natural expression of time becomes, 
ipso facto, the direct and instinctive expression of the 
thought process. Thinking being a time process, a 
generating of a new world, and sound a time expression, 
thought and oral expression become merely the inward 
\and outward sides of a single time-movement. Modern 
psychology seems to be coming more and more to the 
view that the brain movements in thinking, and the 
movements of the vocal organs in speech, are inseparably 
connected, the one being the outward expression of the 
other. This is further evidence of the teleological co- 
ordination of man’s physiological structure prior to the 
actual emergence of language. Primitive man every- 
where apparently felt the causal connection between 
the two, and acted on the impulse of his feeling in using 
sound in his very first steps in language. Even in silent 
thinking we are conscious of a corresponding move- 
ment by the vocal organs when we attend to it, though 
no audible sound issues from the lips. It might, of 
'course, be countered here that this connection between 
tfijnking and the vocal organs may be due to long and 
close association of the two. The evidence, however, 
seems to point to a more fundamental connection.

£. The Dual Power of Language through Conventionalization 
of Natural Sounds 

. . . manifesting one’s thought by the voice with nouns and 
verbs, imaging the opinion of the mind in the stream which flows 
from the lips, as in a mirror. — P lato, Theaetetus, 206. 

And now \fe come to a unique phase of the problem, 
and one that, so far as I know, has been overlooked up 
to the present time. Natural sound can translate or 
express pure time only. It cannot, except in the 
vaguest kind of way, translate or express to the mind 
objects or forms in space. Instrumental music, as a 
pure time art built up of natural sound, illustrates the 
point clearly. In fact, one characteristic of pure time 
as expressed directly by natural sound is its indefinite- 
ness. It is space, and objects in space, that give objec- 
tive definiteness to our world; though time, when 
expressed indirectly by movement or change of position 
of objects in space, takes on a certain borrowed definite- 
ness from the objects concerned, and from their charac- 
teristic movements. But pure time as expressed by 
natural sound can have no objective definiteness at all.^ 

Now the question: How can sound, which in its 
natural form can express time only, and addresses itself 
to the ear, be made to translate a world of spatial objects 
as well, which ar^ clearly differentiated from one 
another, and address themselves to the eye? This could 
be done only by the conventionalization of natural sounds, 
by transmuting sounds into sound symbols, so that while 

161 



THE NEW INVESTIGATION 
» t i 

the natural sensuous sound element still remains, as it 
must, a time expression, the conventionalized sound 
symbol into which it is converted may express either 
time or space. This is what has actually been done in 
every human language. For example, in the expression 
‘The dog barks,’ the conventionalized sound ‘dog,’ 
though conveyed by sound to the ear, expresses a space 
form, i.e. i t raises a spatial image in th e mind; while 
the conventionalized sound ‘barks’ conveys a time 
^'expression. Both of these words have the common 
sensuous element of sound as their raw material, and 
each requires a certain duration of time for its expres- 
sion, as all sound does; but by definite shaping of this 
raw sound material, and by investing the definite shape 
with a definite arbitrary or conventional meaning, the 
two sounds have been differentiated so as to express 
space and time with equal facility. In language, then, 
as we have it in human speech, the natural sound ele- 
ment has been taken up into and practically disappears 
froln our consciousness in its significant symbolic con- 
notation. In other words, the natural sounds have 
been completely transmuted into conventional sound- 
symbols. This is what constitutes language, and has 
enabled man to elaborate a complete space-time world 
of mind which rises above the space-time world of 
nature, and gradually approximate! towards a complete 
mental counterpart of it.

6. The Space-Time Structure of Language 

And Space and Time in concord suited,

This, then, is the unique characteristic of language 
that, while made out of the pure time expression of 
sound, it has* by conventionalization been converted 
into an adequate space-time medium for translating a 
space-time world. By reverting to our illustration of the 



two circles representing the two worlds of nature 4nd 
mind, one can m,ake clear, by a well-selected example, 
the whole significant structure of language in relation 
to the actual world of space and time. 

Let the picture in A represent an actual scene in the 
world of nature, then the language sentence in B will 
represent the same sfcene as translated by language into 
the corresponding world of mind. Here you have an 
actual complex space-time picture in '’the natural world 
transferred by language into the mental world, and set

THE NEW INVESTIGATION^ 

up theire in a space-time synthesis in exact correspon- 
dence with the space-time synthesis in the natural world. 
The mental one is the counterpart of the natural one. 
Of the five connotative words three, ‘grey,’ ‘wolf,’ 
‘field,’ are connotative of space, or objects of space, 
but ‘not marking time,’ as Aristotle puts it ( avev 
Xpovov, Poetics, xx. 8). Two of the three words, 
‘wolf’ and ‘field,’ the nouns, are the primary classifi- 
catory names of objects in space, differentiating the 
genera (or species), as the scientist would say; the 
third word, ‘grey,’ the adjective, is a secondary or 
sub-classificatory word differentiating the species (or 
varieties) within the genus (or species). 

The other two connotative words, ‘trots’ and 
‘slowly,’ connote time in the form of motion through 
space. Of these two words the first one, ‘trots,’ the 
verb, connotes the genus (or species) of motion, the 
second, ‘slowly,’ the species (or variety). 

Furthermore, ‘trots’ not only expresses time by con- 
noting a species of motion, but by its inflected form it 
differentiates time as a present time. Aristotle’s mark- 
ing of this ( Poetics , xx) is concise and to the point. ‘A 
"verb is a composite significant sound, marking time. 
Fqr “man” or “white” does not express the idea of 
“when”; but “walks” or “has walked” does con- 
note time, present or past.’ Hu observed the fact 
of which I have tried to v give the philosophical expo- 
sition. The remaining significant word in the sentence, 
‘across,’ expresses the spatial relation between the 



LANGUAGE 


object and its spatial environment; also, to a less degree, 
a relation in time, since it carries the suggestion' of 
motion. The weak demonstratives ‘the’ and ‘the’ 
may be omitted in a discussion of the general structure 
of language. 

We have spoken above of the permanence of language 
in the world of mind in contrast to the transitoriness of 
the things of sense in the world of nature. To illus- 
trate this distinction so as to complete the contrast, 
consider the same dual scene set out in Fig. 8 above, 
say five minutes afterwards, and we should find it thus: 



Here the central object of interest, the wolf, has dis- 
appeared from the sense picture of the natural world.' J 
The corresponding picture in the world of mind remains 
substantially as it was, with only the time word, ‘trots,’ 
altered by inflection- 1 to ‘trotted,’ to indicate that its 
original counterpart in the vyorld of sense has dis- 
appeared, and belongs now to a past time and to things 
that have vanished.

THE NEW INVESTIGATION ,u 

J ^ 

This^ illustrates, as we have said, practically the whole 
structure of language, and, omitting for the time the 
abstract stratum of language as a later development 
which does not modify the original structure, then of 
the four connotative parts of speech, two, the noun 
and the adjective, connote objects in space, the other 
t&lt;vo, the verb and the adverb, connote movements and 
sequence in time. The prepositions, originally pre- 
fixes or suffixes to connotative words, are the means of 
'expressing relations of space, time, or cause. Con- 
junctions are used for synthesizing given parts into a 
more complex whole. The personal pronoun stands 
for the new individualized world of mind in man, the 
ego , as against the world of nature. That is virtually 
the whole structure of language which was from the 
- beginning predetermined by the space-time structure 
of the worlds of nature and mind, and by the problem 
of translating the former into the latter, and setting it 
up there in a system corresponding to its own nature. 

language, however, is a conventional art ; and while 
the problem confronting all nations and races of people 
is identical, each nation or race, working separately at 
~Tt, would be bound to make its special language symbols 
and structure after its own fashion, so that the languages 
of the world are as various in their external features as 
are the peoples who made them, * Nevertheless in two 
ways they are fundamentally the same; they are all 
made out of the raw material of sound, and they are all

languages. In 1830 the British and Foreign Bible 
Society published a pamphlet of 166 pages, in which a 
single well-known verse from the New Testament — 
‘For God so loved the world that He gave His only 
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should 
not perish, but have everlasting life’ — was rendered in 
630 different languages and dialects. It was interesting 
to see the immense varieties in visual symbols and syn- 
tactic devices, and the common substratum of language 
structure, by which the same complex experience has 
been translated into the world of mind by various 
peoples. 

It is true that in the abstract and complex develop- 
ment of language in the later reflective stages of its 
history, the fundamental space-time structure is often 
partially obscured by the fact that one connotative part 
of speech may be derived from another; but it is only 
obscured, never lost. When a noun, for example, is 
derived from a generic verb as in ‘running is strenuous 
feXercise,’ the noun ‘running’ still contains the time 
element of movement or change. , This is true in all 
cases of derivation of one part of speech from another. 
The detailed consideration of these aspects of language 
^belongs, however, to another place than the present 
treatise, to the science of language rather than the 
philosophy. ,J1 

It should be noted, also that while we have spoken 
here of mind as' the space-time counterpart of nature 
with the task of building up within itself by the symbols 

170 



LANGUAGE 

of language a mental space-time structure correspond- 
ing to the physical space-time world which it intellects, 
that is not the whole story of language. The mind as 
a new cycle of world evolution, though determined in 
its basic structure by the cycle of objective nature below 
it, has characteristics of its own which by introspection 
it can analyse and elaborate and set out in language, so"" 
that the mind, the ego, when actualized in language is 
.not only a reflex or counterpart of the world of nature, 
but also of itself. Psychology is concerned with this 
aspect. I have, however, confined myself to the first 
aspect of language in the present treatment for the sake 
of simplicity and clearness. 

For similar reasons I have omitted any discussion of 
the copula, though that is the element of language and 
grammar that constitutes the alpha and omega of logic. 
The copula is the instrument of definition by which the 
manifold elements which exist in implicit differentiation 
and synthesis in the natural world of sense are explicitly 
differentiated, reunited, and brought to the explidlt 
synthesis of thought. But this multiform material upon 
which the copula is employed in definition is first of all 
gathered from the world of nature and arranged in the 
mind under the forms of space and time by means 06 
concrete nouns and adjectives, transitive and intransi- 
tive verbs, adverbs, *and prepositions. Given this 
primary material gathered and osdered from the world 
of sense, the mind then proceeds to analyse and re- 
synthesize its elements by means of- the copula in the

varioys steps of logic, so that the copula may for the 
time being be omitted from the discussion of the 
primary structure of language. It will find its place in 
the detailed analysis of grammar when we come to the 
science of language in another volume. 

To summarize then, at this point. Man’s problem 
~was to intellect the world; to translate the types from 
the world of nature to the world of mind, and in this 
way elaborate the world of mind. It is the generation 
and evolution of a new world. This generation is a 
time process, and sound as a time expression was the 
direct and natural medium by means of which the gener- 
ating process could be actualized. By articulation 
and conventionalization man succeeded in making 
sound express objects in space as well as sequence in 
time, and in this way transmuted sound into an ade- 
quate single vehicle for representing a space- time world.

Nevertheless, the sensuous sound element does remain 
as the substratum of articulate language, and as language 
issues from the lips it issues in the same time sequence 
as does pure sound, for example, in music. But here 
\ is the unique difference which separates language funda- 
mentally from the other four arts. As language issues 
from the lips, the pure ‘timeness’ of it, as we might 
say, is immediately transmuted and absorbed in the 
conventionalized connotation which is arbitrarily given 
to the differentiated* sounds. Hence in the thought- 
process of intellecting the world by language the actual 
space-time world is translated first into pure time, that 
is, into sound, but is immediately, in the very act as it

were,* retranslated by the conventionalization of sound 
into its former space-time structure within the world 
of mind. 

This transformation of natural sound from a pure 
time expression into a space-time expression, by con- 
ventionalization, which is the unique characteristic of 
language as the instrument of conscious "mind, has, as I 
have said, been overlooked, so far as I know, in the 
■ philosophical discussions of language. Lessing was the 
first philosopher who classified and expounded the arts 
upon the ground of the two forms of sense, space, and 
time. In his Laokoon , where he elaborates the idea, he 
classified architecture, sculpture, and painting as the 
space representative arts; music and poetry as the time 
representatives. The Laokoon was published in 1766, 
170 years ago, and the classification worked out there 
has been generally accepted since that time. Robert 
Louis Stevenson follows this classification without sub- 
stantial modification in his essay on Style in Literature, 
188 g. 

But the symbols of language in the dual function 
which they perform are, as stated above, essentially 
different from the media of the other arts. Architec- 

J ture, sculpture, and painting all work in pure space 
media of form or colour, and address their expressions 
, to the sense of sight alone. Their representations are 
'• strictly limited by the nature of space, and that in two 
ways. First, a picture or a statue is a fixed, immovable 
spatial image, representing only a single moment of 

»74 



t THE NATURAL ARTg OF^PACE AND TIME

time. It can have no movement, and hence cannot 
express time at all, although it may suggest time by (he 
particular moment chosen , or by the symbolic arrange- 
ment of the parts of a complex picture, as, for example, 
Bocklin’s ‘ Vita Somnium Breve ’ , a picture in three parts, 
childhood in the foreground, youth and romance in the 
middle ground,* and old age and death in the background. 
But this is only a symbolic suggestion of the time process 
of life, not an actual representation of it. 

Second, in proportion as it becomes great or unique ' 
as a work of art, the Parthenon, for example, or the 
‘Sistine Madonna’, or the ‘David’ of Michelangelo, 
it cannot be duplicated, so that the individual piece of art 
remains an individual physical thing, and is limited to 
one particular place as any other physical object is. We 
have to travel to Athens or Dresden or Florence to see 
it. It cannot for this reason become an adequately 
expressive instrument of free mind, whose unique char- 
acteristic is its ubiquitous and omnipresent nature; it 
occupies space and time as its natural domain. * 

Music, on the other hand, working in natural sound, 
is a pure time expression without spatial dimensions, 
and is limited by the nature of time, also in two ways. 
First, as a pure time expression it addresses itself to the 
ear alone, and has no power of representing spatial 
objects that address themselves to the eye. Second, as 
a pure time expression it is evanescent. Uttered in 
one moment it is gone in the next, as fleeting as 
time itself. *7

W ( 

Th^se four arts, then, all working in natural sensuous 
media, and addressing themselves directly to the sense 
organs of sight or hearing respectively, are each limited 
to the sense forms of either space or time. They are 
not the free symbols of representation, which the mind 
requires to elaborate its own biform world. 

But with the symbols of language everything is differ- 
ent. The natural sound elements out of which it is 
made have been freed from their time limits by trans- 
mutation into conventionalized symbols. Furthermore, 
by conventionalization these symbols hare been transferred 
from the realm of the senses to the realm of the imagination. 
This is a vital point in the problem. The fundamental 
difference between the senses and the imagination is 
that the senses as image faculties are restricted to their 
local environment in space and time. To make an 
impress on the senses the actual objects or sounds must 
be within the range of the sense organs of sight or 

The imagination, on the other hand, as an image 
faculty, is freed from the sensuous space-time limits of 
the natural world; or in other words, the imagination 
is itself the supra-sensuous space-time world of free 
mind, the potential realm of all possible space-time 
mental images, and the symbols of language address 
themselves directly through the ifcnses to this inward 
world. The significant import of language does not 
reside in the particular natural sound, shape, colour, 
size, etc., of the particular set of spoken or written 





words as they strike the ear or eye, as is the case with 
the natural arts. The import resides in the conven- 
tional meaning. Hence the mind must first interpret 
the sound which strikes the ear — ‘horse,’ for example 
— and then the corresponding image rises in the 
imagination, but not for the senses. If, for example, 
I quote here the words from Wordsworth, suggested 
by the statue of Newton at Cambridge: 

Of Newton with his prism and silent face. 

The marble index of a mind for ever 

Voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone, 

the actual form of the words that strike the eye — or ear 
if orally quoted — has no natural resemblance whatever 
to Newton, as had the marble statue. But the conven- 
tional connotation of the words carried through the 
sense organs of ear or eye to the imagination to which 
they are addressed, and not to the senses, at once raises 
there the image of Newton and the sleepless exploring 
activity of his mind. To see the actual sculptured statue 
one must travel to Cambridge, where it stands in its 
particular niche 1Y1 space. But in the three lines of 
poetry, by translating the image from the natural art o£ 
sculpture to the conventional art of language, Words- 
worth has transferred the likeness from the realm of 
sense to the realm of the imagination, and has thus 
liberated it from the rigid marble and its fixed point in 
space, and made it ubiquitous ahd omnipresent. 

Furthermore, the marble gave us only the space 
representation of Newton, his physical appearance to

the eye at one particular moment of his life. It gave us 
no time nor motion. The printed poetry, though pre- 
sented to the eye in a fixed space-time pattern, gives 
us the time-movement of his mind as well, ‘for ever 
voyaging through strange seas of thought, alone. ’ Words- 
worth did not get this time-idea from the marble statue, 
but from his previous knowledge of Newton; though 
with this previous knowledge in his mind as he contem- 
plated the statue in an unreflecting mental attitude, he 
might himself have imagined that he saw it in the 
marble. As pointed out above, the symbols of lan- 
guage, though originally made from the raw time- 
material of sound, are changed by conventionalization 
into a space-time medium so as to become the com- 
pletely efficient instrument for the elaboration of the

point, however, we are anticipating the matter of our 
next chapter.

CHAPTER XI 


LAST step: translation of language from time to 

SPACE *• 

Words are fleeting in pronunciation, but permanent when 
written down. — Bacon, Advancement of Learning. 

Statues of brass or marble will perish ; and statues made in 
imitation of them are not the same statues, nor the same work- 
manship, any more than a copy of a picture is the same picture. 
But print and reprint a thought a thousand times over, and with 
material of any kind, carve it in wood or engrave it on stone, the 
thought is eternally and identically the same thought in every 
case. It has a capacity of unimpaired existence, unaffected by 
change of matter, and is essentially distinct and of a nature 
different from everything else that we know of or can conceive. 
— Thomas Paine, The Age of Reason. 

And now we come to the final step in the making of 
language. By the conventionalization of sound in^oral 
speech, which is.the actual language, man accomplished 
two things. First, he changed the vague suggestiveness 
of natural sounds into perfectly defined, articulated, 
limited sound symbols, that can be clearly differentiated 
from one another by the ear, as ‘rat,’ ‘cat.’ Second, 
by conventionalization he transformed the pure time 
symbols into space-time symbols, as in the sentence, 
‘The bird sings,’ where ‘bird’ is a J representation of 
space, ‘sings’ of time, though both are carried from

i "e 

the lips of theSpeaker to the ear of thfe listener upon 
the. common substratum of sound, that is, time. 

But this conventionalization of sound in oral speech 
did not completely solve the problem set to conscious 
reason, of raising above the transient world of nature a 
permanent and actual world of mind. Oral language 
even when conventionalized was still dependent upon 
the natural sound element out of which it was made, 
and consequently was still under the limitations of time. 
•It was evanescent ; the pure flux of Heraclitus. As soon 
as the words were sounded they vanished, and at once 
ceased to exist, and when required again they had to be 
reproduced by the will and vocal organs, only to dis- 
appear immediately once more. There was no inde- 
pendent objective permanence at all in oral language. 
The only permanence was in the memory of the living 
individual that could produce the language again when 
required, and it had to be generated each time it was 
required. Without the presence of the living human 
agent the thing had completely vanished. 

But the characteristic of the woi^ld of mind, as 
already noted, is that it combines permanency with 
motion. As contrasted with the forward vanishing 
series in the natural world, the world of mind advances 
by a cumulative movement, translating type after type 
from the sensuous world of nature.into its own supra- 
sensuous world, and setting them up there in a fixed 
non-vanishing structure. A man who writes his diary, 
transferring the vanishing incidents of his life in the 

iu&gt; I 8o 



lajst step: from ryiE to space 
&gt;' &gt; ,, 
natural world into the non-vanishing jhedium (lan- 
guage) of the world of mind, would illustrate thepoirjt, 
though we are going ahead of the logic in illustrating it 
by written language at this stage. Oral speech alone, 
because of its continually vanishing nature, could not 
accomplish this. It could not escape the evanescence 
of sound out of which it is made. Consequently, an 
oral speech there was no means of raising a fixed objec- 
tive structure that would preserve the vanishing time- 
sequence of things and events in an ever-accumulating 
non - vanishing present, as the nature of conscious 
developing reason demands. In the activity of reason 
as we see it elaborating its own world to-day, in the 
written or printed symbols of language, the significance 
of the natural world is being steadily gleaned from its 
vanishing stream, and being stored up in a non-vanishing 
continuously present world. The library of the British 
Museum would illustrate adequately this cumulative 
movement of reason, where the various phases through 
which the world has passed in its previous evolution, 
themselves now vanished in time, are preserved in a 
permanent present, a pure world of mind though stored 
in the sensuous material of paper and ink. If we think 
of what a university, say, would be without a single 
book, and without blackboards or note-books, shut off 
from a vanished and irrecoverable past, we should have 
a picture of the limitations which time sets upon oral 
speech alone as an instrument of conscious mind. 

To obtain the required permanence the time symbols 



THE NEV^/ INVESTIGATION 

of oral speech had to l )e converted in some way or 
other into space symbol since space has that fixity 
which time lacks. Hei^ce all nations that made any 
considerable advance in the elaboration of their mental 
world were led by instii'ot and necessity to search for 
some kind of space symbols &gt; written speech as we now 
call it, that would crystallize and hold,. the vanishing 
stream of oral speech. 

This, however, was a fundamentally difficult prob- 
- lem. Language is made out of sounds, and how could 
a sound be represented by a spatial picture? Or more 
explicitly, how could th£ fluent sound-symbols of actual 
oral language, which ar£ expressed in time alone, and 
are without visual shape i be converted into non-fluent 
space - symbols, which would give them permanence 
without at the same time destroying the movement of 
time and thought? The difficulty of this problem is 
evidenced by the fact that there have been races of 
people who had developed a highly perfected oral lan- 
guage, reaching backward over many hundreds of years, 
who never succeeded in converting u it into a corre- 
sponding written language. They were forced by this 
barrier to remain in a vanishing present world, isolated 
even from the most significant achievements in their 
own past history, so that they could make no appreci- 
able progress at all in V^hat we cill civilization. The 
Cree Indians, for example, who lived for untold 
generations upon the plains of western Canada, had no 
written language prior to 1841, yet their oral language 

182 «» 



L;jsT Slip; FROM T^ilF TO SPACE 
** &gt; 

was as highly developed in its grammar&gt;and syntax as 
the English or any other modem civilized language. *In 
1841 the ingenious missionary, James Evans, invented 
for them a very simple system of syllabic writing into 
which parts of the Bible could be translated, and which 
is still extensively used among them. 

The detailed account of the invention and perfecting 
of written language would be a long story if it 
could be fully told, and belongs to the science of lan- 
guage rather than to the philosophy. An attempt will 
be made to give what is known about it in a separate 
treatise on the Evolution of the Alphabet. Here it will 
be necessary only to suggest the main headings of the 
story. 

The written speech in modem languages is merely 
an arbitrary and artificial spatial representation of the 
original language of oral speech. In the first steps of 
written language, however, there was no real connec- 
tion at all between the written characters and the actual 
oral language. In every known case, so far as, the 
records have come down to us, when man first felt the 
need of a written record to preserve a present experi- 
ence for a future time, or to transmit it to someone at 
a distance from him in space, he began by pictorial 
representations of natural objects that were seen and 
known. A bird w;vs represented not by ‘b-i-r-d,’ but 
by a picture of a bird, an animal by the picture of an 
animal, and so on. From these firjt natural drawings 
or pictographs man gradually moved forward to the

THE NEV^JNVESTIGATIQN 

‘ % 

next step, ther, ideograph, where the visual objects by 
symbolic associations were used in very crude ways to 
represent thoughts and actions and inner experiences. 
But this mode of written speech had still no connection 
at all with the real language of oral speech. Nor could 
it be called in any true sense a written language corre- 
sponding to oral language. It was at best but a lisping 
and fragmentary makeshift for language. It was merely 
a spatial representation of spatial things, and could give 
jio organized synthesis at all of the space-time world 
which man was already organizing effectively in his oral 
speech. 

Finally, and perhaps in all cases by some lucky com- 
bination of accident and ingenious thinking, the exact 
details of which are now lost in a long vanished and 
irrecoverable past, the momentous step was taken, 
when the ideographs became phonograms, that is, when 
the written characters became representations, not of 
things that are seen, but of sounds that are heard. How, 
precisely, this last step was taken, converting time into 
space, will perhaps never be fully known. In this way, 
however, the actual sound-symbols of oral language 
were translated into corresponding space - symbols, 
which preserves them from the evanescence of sound 
out“ of which oral language is made. 

The conversion pf the sound-symbols of time into 
corresponding form-symbols of space which gave to 
language an accumulating “permanence without destroy- 
ing or altering its life and movement, was the consum- 

,8 +

• i. 

mation of the long language-making process. It was 
the most momentous and fruitful single achievement of 
the human intellect, since it was the condition of all 
the cumulative progress that man has since made in the 
world of free mind, which is his peculiar sphere. 

In the development of the Aryan languages, the 
branch to which our own language belongs, this uhion 
of time and space symbols was accomplished in the 
evolution of the alphabet, where the oral sounds of lan- 
guage were resolved first into their twenty-six elements' 
(I am again using arbitrarily the number in our own 
English alphabet) of vowels and consonants, and each 
one of these twenty-six attached to a separate space 
symbol, so that language became at one and the same 
time fluid and fixed ; change and permanence united in 
a single synthesis. This actual union of motion and 
permanence is a new phenomenon in world evolution. 
The oral language is still the actual language, since it is 
the direct expression of the time movement of thought. 
The written language consists in the transference df this 
sound language, to a spatial representation, to preserve 
it from the evanescence of time. But in the trans- 
ference, while the time movement is arrested and 
crystallized in space, it is not destroyed. The natpral 
time sequence of the thought and the corresponding 
time-flow of oral speech are preserved first of all in the 
linear arrangement of the wprds on the spatial page. 
Second, the conventional connotation of the words 
themselves remains the same as in oral speech, by means

of which , u as we fi’ave already seen, language can express 
objects in space and sequence in time with equal 
facility. 

The miracle — miracle, I mean, when compared with 
anything to be found in the world in the pre-language 
stage of its history — that has been accomplished here 
can be clearly seen if we set out in written- form three 
or four lines of poetry where movement and action — 
time expression — are the dominant quality. These 
from Burns’s Tam o’ Shanter, for example: 

As Tammie glowered, amazed and curious, 

The mirth and fun grew fast and furious; 

The piper loud and louder blew, 

The dancers quick and quicker flew. 

They reeled, they set, they crossed, they cleekit. 

Till ilka carlin swat and reekit. 

As soon as the vanishing oral expression is turned into 
writing, or print, it is arrested and becomes fixed and 
still; but the movement of the piper and the dancers 
contirfUes. Though stilled in the spatial page the piper 
pipes on and the dancers dance. The actual dance 
ceased at midnight a hundred and fifty - odd years ago, 
vanished in time from the stage of the world. The 
representation of it in oral speech would have been as 
evanescent as time. But as soon as Bums turns it into 
ink, into visible symbols in space, the player plays and 
the dancers dance on for §ver. Turned into print, the 
dance movement becomes, in Browning’s phrase, an 
‘eternal petrifaction.’ Or, in the abstract logic of

&gt; ,» 

prose, written language is the crys&amp;llization of the 
fluidity of time, while time still retains its movement 
and fluidity even while standing fixed and motionless in 
space. This, as it seems to me, is the unique charac- 
teristic of language which marks it off from all other 
phenomena of the world, the peculiar fusion of motion 
and permanence in a single synthesis without destroying 
the nature of either, and making language the com- 
pletely adequate instrument of free and conscious mind.

CHAPTER XII 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 

U* 

The termination of the world in a man appears to be the last 
victory of the intelligence. . . . An individual man is a fruit which 
it costall the foregoing ages to form and ripen. . . . Each individual 
soul is such, in virtue of its being a power to translate the world 
into some particular language of its own. — Emerson, The Method 
of Nature, 1841. 


i. Deductions of Logic 

Our story of evolution ended with a stirring in the brain-organ 
of the latest of nature’s experiments; but that stirring of con- 
sciousness transmutes the whole story and gives meaning to its 
symbolism. — Eddington, Science and the Unseen World, 1929. 

It may be worth while now to summarize in a page or 
two the view of world evolution as outlined above, a 
spiral structure of which man’s created language forms 
the final story. In this summary I adopt the organic 
hypothesis, which assumes that mind is a basic and per- 
manent element in the world, self-determining and 
purposive in its nature, and the directing agency in the 
evolutionary process throughout its history. While 
the acceptance or rejection of this metaphysical hypo- 
thesis is not essential to the acceptance or rejection of 
the scientific exposition of the birth and structure of

language giver? in the preceding pages, »4ie choice of one 

or other hypothesis does, of course, make a rather 
complete difference in the diction and phraseology 
chosen to set out the specific exposition. To a mecha- 
nist many of the terms which I have used may appear 
altogether unwarranted or quite wrong. So far as that 
is true I ask, his indulgence for the use of those tdtms 
and turns of expression that are dependent upon and 
consonant with the organic hypothesis, and grant him 
the right to substitute his own terms, where necessary, * 
from the opposite hypothesis, but request only that 
he consider the specific exposition of the birth and 
structure of language on its own merits, without preju- 
dice from the hypothesis with which I have associated it. 

I accept the organic hypothesis of a self-directing and 
purposive activity in the world because it seems the 
only coherent and logical view when one considers all 
the evidence from matter to man. A self-directing 
and purposive activity appears everywhere in the plant 
world, becomes more pronounced and obvious m the 
animal world, sp.d emerges to explicit activity in man^ 
Besides, the whole series in the rising scale of world 
forms from matter to man are causally related to one 
another in the relation of sustaining and sustained. 
That the upper part of the scale, the organic world, 
should manifest ejjplicit purposive and self-directing 
activity in all its growth, life, and habits, seems more 
than mere presumptive evidence that the inorganic 
base out of which it arose and upon which it entirely

depends for its^ife and all its purposiVe activities is 

also « purposive structure, though the purposiveness is 
not as yet apparent to human perception. 

On this hypothesis, then, the life and mind of the 
world, which in its time-evolution rises steadily, and 
in an apparently unbroken ascending series, upward 
through the cycles of insentient and sentient life, even- 
tually comes to a focus in the organism and mind of 
man, breaks through the enveloping forms of space and 
-time, and emerges into free and conscious individuali- 
ties. The world which was formerly a single sensuous 
world, in rising into this new cycle of its evolution, 
breaks in a manner, into two worlds. The sensuous 
space-time world of nature is duplicated by the supra- 
sensuous space-time world of mind, which emerges 
now, radiating from individualized mind-points, and 
holds all space and all time in its single view; and turn- 
ing back upon itself is confronted with the endlessly 
diversified forms of its own preconscious evolution. 
The task set then to the mind of the world, when it 
emerged to freedom and consciousness in the organism 
of man, was the task of entering into mental possession 
of "the innumerable diversified forms of all the lower 
cycjes of its own life-history. This it could do only 
step by step, by translating the multitudinous types of 
all its preconscious history one by* one into its own 
supra-sensuous world of u free mind. If there is any 
reality in the theoty of the organic unity of the world 
and the natural evolution of its successive aspects in

SUMMARY ,AND ^CONCLUSION, • 

time, then man is the world at that point .where it 
awakens to consciousness and turns back upon itself to 
explore and know its own nature ; and this self-explora- 
tion, and the growing record of its results in language, 
constitute a new cycle in world evolution. 

To accomplish this task of elaborating a new supra- 
sensuous world, patterned after the sensuous world of. 
nature, man, with his newly emerged conscious mind, 
had to have for his new world-building material supra- 
sensuous symbols, freed, in some way or other, from 
the sense-limiting media of space and time. Specifically, 
he required time-symbols lifted above the evanescence of 
time, and space-symbols released from the fixity of space. 

Starting with his own natural sounds, which as time- 
expressions were the natural symbols for the time- 
process of intellecting the world, but which in their 
natural state could express • time-manifestations only, 
man first transmuted these natural sounds into definite 
and conventionalized sound-symbols, which could ex- 
press manifestations of space as well as of time, and in 
this way made ‘the adequate biform instrument for the 
translation of a biform world. , 

Next, to preserve this sound language from the 
evanescence of time, man succeeded, after long experi- 
mentation, in translating his sound-symbols into corre- ' 
sponding space-symbols so as to secure permanence, 
without, however, destroying or altering the time 
movement of oral speech. By this translation and 
consequent amalgamation of the symbols of time and

..i ll 

space, so, that ttTe content could without alteration be 
expressed in either of these sense-forms, man gained 
for language that spaceless and timeless character which 
corresponds to the nature of free and conscious mind; 
motion and rest, change and permanency, fused in a 
single synthesis where each retains its own nature while 
freed from its own limits. The marriage df Heraclitus 
and Parmenides. 

The other four arts, as pointed out above, each work- 
ing only in space or in time, are only half-transmuted, 
as we might say, from nature to mind. They are only 
half-liberated from the sense limits of the natural 
world. Language by conventionalization and by amal- 
gamation of the forms of time and space is freed from 
the limits of both ; and in language, and in language 
alone, the mind has attained its full freedom, has created 
an efficient instrument for the elaboration of its new 
world. Hence all the intercourse of life is carried on 
in language as it alone expresses freely the double world 
of spade and time in which man lives. 

When Keats wrote his Ode on a Grecian Urn the rigid 
spatial beauty of the marble, arrested and motionless 
for centuries, was instantaneously liberated in the move- 
ment; of time ,„ even though it now stands still as marble 
'again in the ink of the lines; motion and stillness in 
magic, though actual combination. * Keats was struck 
with the durability of the marble as contrasted with the 
vanishing beauty of natural life: 

For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair. 

&lt;192 



SUMMARY AINU jCU INCLUSION . 


But to obtain* this durability in marMe ail motion in 
time was excluded, a single moment given in fixed 
isolation from all before and after. Language restores 
the motion and life of time, and also invests the whole 
with a durability outlasting the marble’s. By trans- 
lating the beauty from the natural marble to the 
conventional symbols in ink, which may be mechanically 
reproduced and multiplied ad infinitum without loss of 
import, the beauty actually becomes a thousand times 
more durable than marble. A single accidental etf- # 
plosion could destroy the Parthenon. What accident, 
short of a world cataclysm, could destroy the Odyssey, 
multiplied and distributed as it is over the whole earth’s 
surface? 


2. The Perception of Poetry 

Wc see then how far the monuments of wit and learning are 
more durable than the monuments of power, or of the J hands. 
For have not the verses of Homer continued twenty-five hundred 
years, or more, without the loss of a syllable or letter; during 
which time infinite palaces, temples, castles, cities, have been 
decayed and demolished? It is not possible to have the true 
pictures or statues of Cyrus, Alexander, Caesar , no, nor c/ the 
kings or great personages of much later years ; for the originals •&gt; 
cannot last, and the copies cannot but lose of the life and truth. 
But the images of men’s wits and knowledges remain in books, 
exempted from the wrong of time, and capable of perpetual 
renovation. Neither are they fitly to be called images, because 
they generate still, and cast their seeds in the minds of others,

provoking and causing infinite actions and opinions in succeeding 
ages': ^o that, if the invention of the ship was thought so noble, 
which carrieth riches and commodities from place to place, and 
consociateth the most remote regions in participation of their 
fruits; how much more are letters to be magnified, which, as 
ships, pass through the vast seas of time, and make ages so distant 
to participate of the wisdom, illuminations, and inventions, the 
one of the other! — B acon, Advancement of Learning. 

Since language attains its most precise and perfect 
expression in poetry it would not be unfitting to close 
a prose dissertation on language by some lines from 
poets who have thought and written about it. By a 
lucky chance the similarity and contrast between the 
natural arts and the conventional art of language can be 
clearly set out by setting side by side two sonnets by 
the two masters of their respective arts, and of thought 
as well, in their century, Michelangelo and Shake- 
speare. It so happened that Michelangelo died in the 
same year (1564) in which Shakespeare was bom, 
a fact-- which gives an additional fortuitous interest to 
the comparison. Shakespeare was not, a professional 
dialectician like Plato; at least, so far as we know, he 
did J not practise the dialectic art. But he has a dis- 
concerting habit of arriving at the last syllogism in a 
, dialectical series without the labour of the intervening 
steps; so that when the logician haj worked his slow 
way through a long dialectical process, and has arrived 
at the last syllogism which is to set out the consumma- 
ting truth which he has been following, he unexpectedly 



\ i i SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION *

meets Shakespeare at the end casuallj^handing to him 
the same truth in a quite off-hand manner, as thbugh 
he had incidentally picked it up by the wayside. I 
chanced upon his sonnet on Language in the dim 
recesses of memory after the foregoing treatise was 
completed. 

Shakespeare was cognizant of the unique character 
of language in the world, and particularly of the power 
of arresting and preserving the vanishing things of the 
world of sense. Poets and philosophers had already' 
reflected upon the durability of the natural plastic arts 
when contrasted with the fragile organic forms of 
nature; particularly sculpture, where the forms of 
beauty were ‘wrought in hard mountain marble.’ Of 
this time-resisting characteristic of the plastic arts 
Michelangelo has given us perhaps the most impres- 
sive image in his sonnet on The Artist and his Work, 
addressed to the beautiful and gifted Lady Vittoria 
Colonna, the friend of his later years. Part of the im- 
press of his lines is due no doubt to the weight of 
evidence we feel behind them in Michelangelo’s own 
works in sculpture. 

How can that be, lady, which all men learn 
By long experience? Shapes that seeia alive 
Wrought in hard mountain marble, will survive 
Their maker? whom the years to dust return! 

Thus to effect cause yields. Art hath her turn, 

And triumphs over Nature. who strive 
With sculpture, know this well; her wonders live 
In spite of time and death, those tyrants stem.

so l can ^ive long life to both of u^* 

In either way, by colour or by stone, 

Making the semblance of thy face and mine. 

Centuries hence when both are buried, thus 
Thy beauty and my sadness shall be shown. 

And men shall say, ‘For her ’twas wise to pine -’ 1 

But even the ‘hard mountain marble,’ though in per- 
manence far surpassing all natural forms of beauty, is 
not eternally immune from the ejects of time. In the 
°end it is only a matter of relative durability. Given a 
sufficient period of time, and time will change and 
wear down the marble also. This is what Shakespeare 
saw (as Horace had seen before him, though not in 
quite the same altruistic fashion), that nothing in nature 
nor even in the plastic arts can eventually escape the 
never-ceasing detrition of time; that written language 
alone, because it is a conventional and not a natural art, 
addressing itself to the imagination, and not to the 
senses, and capable, therefore, of being illimitably re-

produced without loss or modification of the ^substance 
of beauty which it transmits, written language -alone 
has the unique power of transcending time and change, 
and of becoming thus the adequate instrument for 
elaborating that inward, supra-sensuous, non-vanishing 
world of mind in which man 'lives and moves and has 
his being .’ j Shakespeare perceived this clearly, and 
taking up the question where Michelangelo and the 
others had left it, he gave us in a single sonnet the most 
memorable statement that I know of this aspect of 
language, a statement where the lucidity of thought is 
made still more lucid by the ‘beauty imperishable’ of 
the expression. 

Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea 
But sad mortality o’crsways their power. 

How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea, 

Whose action is no stronger than a flower? 

O, how shall summer’s honey breath hold out 
Against the wreckful siege of battering days, 

When rocks impregnable are not so stout, 

Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays? 

O fearful rrfeditation! Where, alack, 

Shall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid? 

Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back? 

Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid? 

O, none, unless this miracle have might/ 

That in black ink my love may still shine bright. 

It would be hard to improve upon the clear logical 
image which Shakespeare has given 6s here of the unique 
character of language as a phenomenon among other

phenomena of th% world — its immunity from time and 
change, its silent and successful resistance to the ‘wreck- 
ful siege of battering days,’ to which all other forms in 
the world both of nature and of the natural arts must 
soon or late succumb.
