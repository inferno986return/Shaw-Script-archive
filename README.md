# Shaw-Script-archive
Archive of the Shaw-Script PDFs from https://shavian.info which presumably were scanned from the National Library of Australia

Issue 2 *may* be held in the University of Reading's special collection. I plan to ask them about it.

I want to compile the Shaw Script issues into their own book with the spelling guide and perhaps the shavian.info dictionary.
