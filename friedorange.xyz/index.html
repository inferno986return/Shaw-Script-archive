<p>Hello, there! Welcome to my little corner of the World Wide Web. Here I have a few pages dedicated to things that fascinate me. I hope you will find the information interesting or useful.</p>

<h2><a href="gimini/index.html">Gimini Retro Game Consoles</a></h2>

<p>In the late 1970s and early ’80s, the dawn of the 8-bit era in home video games, one family of consoles still had dedicated game chips instead of a CPU and ROM. They use cartridges, but work more like the early ‘Pong’ consoles; the most common system is usually known as PC-50x today. When I couldn't find specific information on adding a direct video output to get a clearer picture, I did a bit of my own reverse-engineering.</p>-->

<h2><a href="quikscript/intro.html">Quikscript Pages</a></h2>

<p>I have created some new computer fonts and other materials for helping people to learn and use Quikscript, an alternative alphabet of 40 letters designed for the English language. It allows for logical, predictable spellings while being faster and easier to read and write than our conventional Latin alphabet.</p>
