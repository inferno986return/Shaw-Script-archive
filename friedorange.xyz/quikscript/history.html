<h2>History</h2>

<p>The following texts give some insight into the origins of Quikscript as we know it today, and the many people behind its inspiration and development.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://cdm16471.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15457coll1/id/105/">Manual of Current Shorthand</a> (from Rider University)<br>
By Henry Sweet, 1892</p>
<p>Henry Sweet is perhaps best known for his being the prototype of Henry Higgins in Shaw’s play, <cite>Pygmalion</cite>, but his shorthand scheme is the oldest inspiration cited for what would become the Shaw Alphabet. This book describes it in very great detail: from the first principles of its orthographic mode, which replaces the letters a–z with new shapes while retaining the current spellings; to a full-blown shorthand based on recording sounds of speech, which (with its many abbreviations) could have been used for verbatim reporting.</p>

<p><a href="shawpreface.html">Preface</a> to <a rel="external" href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54583"><cite>The Miraculous Birth of Language</cite></a> by Richard Albert Wilson, 1923<br>
By George Bernard Shaw, 1941</p>
<p>Shaw held a lifelong disdain for the conventional Latin alphabet and its English orthography, going so far as to do all of his writing in Pitman Shorthand. This piece is one of Shaw’s earliest documented public pleas for a new alphabet, to be specifically designed for writing English. He explains the reasoning behind the choice of Sweet’s system as a starting point for future development. Further, he emphasises the statistical incentive of saving the time and effort of writing in our present orthography, as opposed to merely pointing out quirky spellings as others usually did.</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="https://articles.c-a-s-t.com/@helloleo">Shavian</a> (from Medium)<br>
By Leo Philp, 2017-2019</p>	
<p>This series looks into the origins and development of the Shaw Alphabet, examining the primary sources held at the University of Reading. Containing photographs of original correspondence and records of design iterations, these blog posts are a fascinating read for anyone interested in the details of how this alphabet was created.</p>

<p><a href="files/Sound-writing.pdf">Sound-writing 1892‒1972: Bernard Shaw and a modern alphabet</a><br>
By Kingsley Read, 1972</p>
<p>This booklet was prepared for an exhibition at the Library of the University of Reading. It tells the story of Shaw’s desire for a new alphabet, giving rise to Shavian and, later, Quikscript. It includes samples of the four winning entries to the alphabet competition in the late 1950s, which currently cannot be found anywhere else on the internet. This PDF was uploaded to the Quikscript Yahoo! Group and was derived from scans of the original booklet.</p>

<p><a href="files/Second%20Shaw.htm">Revised Shaw Alphabet of Kingsley Read</a><br>
By Jon Zuck, 2002</p>
<p>This HTML document was written by Jon Zuck, creator of the Jerome font, with input from other key members of the early online Shavian/Quikscript community. While Shavian had something of a following at that time, Quikscript remained very obscure. Much of this piece, therefore, is devoted to explaining the differences between the two for a Shavian-savvy audience. The authors added to the existing canon, too, by giving new names to the letters and their various alternative forms; these are the names are used throughout my own website. The unique features and relative merits of Quikscript are discussed, along with justifications for the changes.</p>
<p>I found this file archived on the Quikscript Yahoo! Group. Since it forms a notable part of the alphabet’s ongoing history, I decided to republish it here so it might be seen by a wider audience. The only modification I made was to add the provision for modern web fonts—otherwise the Shavian and Quikscript characters could only be seen if the requisite fonts were actually installed on your computer.</p>
