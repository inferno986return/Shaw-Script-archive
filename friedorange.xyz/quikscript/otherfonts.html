<p>An original handwriting-style font with large counters and apertures which help to lend it good legibility. It originally came in three versions, each with a different character mapping: one Shavian-like, one using QS‑SAMPA and one using the Unicode Private Use Area (PUA). The Unicode version has a wide character repertoire (albeit in a different style) comprising the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts, since it is based on an existing open-source font, Gentium. A customised version was later made for use with Malt's International Quikscript spreadsheets, with a unique ASCII character mapping and several ligatures included.</p>

<p class="lhfix">A handwriting-style font which has a casual look, rather than trying to emulate the appearance of the <cite>Quikscript Manual</cite>. It contains the complete Quikscript alphabet, numerals and punctuation in a consistent style (the loops of <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span> differ from those of <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span>, though). It also possesses the degree sign and prime marks; these are welcome inclusions which I also happen to recommend for new Quikscript fonts.</p>

<p>An well-crafted font with classic Art Deco flair, equally suited to text and display applications. The letter-forms are condensed and have relatively high waistlines yet remain quite readable. Common Quikscript ligatures are provided via OpenType's Standard Ligatures feature; it is only unfortunate that it contains no characters besides Quikscript ones. Even the most basic punctuation would require switching fonts, which unacceptably limits its usability for word processing (although in webpages, it is possible to specify an order of preference for fonts).</p>

<h2>Historical fonts</h2>

<p>The following fonts were found in various places on the internet; many were originally shared to the Quikscript Yahoo! Group (now on Groups.io). Some were found on the old Shavian Yahoo! Group (now defunct). Beware: these fonts may use idiosyncratic encodings, contain glyphs from copyrighted commercial fonts, and generally lack refinement compared to those listed above. While some were explicitly released as free software, most did not come with any kind of license document detailing copyright considerations. They are made available here in good faith for the purpose of research and preservation.</p>

<p class="lhfix">The earliest known computer font for Quikscript. The letters appear to have been vectorised from scans of the Surprise Edition of <cite>Cole’s Funny Picture Book No. 2</cite>; the name Second Shaw and lack of a <span class="qs"></span> are owed to that publication. The size, weight and positioning of the letters is rather inconsistent. The numerals and other symbols were borrowed from a Shavian font called ShawScript. Unique ASCII character mapping.</p>

<p class="lhfix">A casual handwritten-style face with a relatively high waistline. It includes the ligatures, half-letters and alternative <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span> as used in Senior Quikscript plus the auxiliary letters <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span>. The stroke width varies wildly on certain characters for no apparent reason. Most of the non-Quikscript characters were taken from a Shavian font called Ghoti, which itself took some from Arial. Unique ASCII character mapping.</p>

<p class="lhfix">A font for Senior Quikscript with the requisite tight spacing and special alternative forms of letters. The optional letters <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span> are now included. The letter skeletons are clearly distinguishable and resemble neat handwriting. The stroke modulation has been tamed but remains somewhat inconsistent. The character mapping is based on that of the Shavian fonts of the time, with extra codepoints allocated for the five letters with no Shavian equivalents.</p>

<p>An altered version of Jerome intended for Junior Quikscript. As such, the half-letters and ligatures have been removed and the spacing has been made much looser. Two versions were produced: one with the same Shavian-like character mapping as Jerome and one adhering to QS‑SAMPA, which was one of the proposed community standards published on the Yahoo! Group.</p>

<p class="lhfix">A Junior Quikscript font based on Jerome, with most of the letters reworked to more closely resemble those seen in the alphabet chart of the original Quikscript Manual. The strokes are now heavier and have rounded endings but the weight is still inconsistent on certain letters, especially <span class="qs">  </span>. <span class="qs"></span> has been tweaked (coincidentally, resembling Shavian 𐑵) to make it display more clearly at small sizes. This font was superseded by Kingsley and King Plus.</p>

<p class="lhfix">An update of Kwikskript. Historically, it has been the most commonly used Quikscript font. This version is a fork which has had multiple contributors; it seems odd that they chose to maintain this font over the years rather than the newer King Plus (see below), even though it already existed. This means that Kingsley lacks enhancements such as the matching <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span>. In the original (ASCII-mapped) version of Kingsley, those four letters were moved to new codepoints (the same as those described for the “Suave” encoding).</p>

<p class="lhfix">This was originally an update of Kingsley but has since fallen out of use and is no longer as up-to-date. More of the characters have been updated to match the new style and special glyphs for the Senior Quikscript half-letters have been added. Interestingly, the optional letters <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span> have been given more cursive forms.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, this is a monospaced version of King Plus. It also contains compatibly-spaced Latin capitals which have been lifted from Arial and Arial Narrow—typing with these would require a custom keyboard layout to be installed, however, as the Quikscript characters still occupy the  ASCII range as in the previous fonts.</p>

<p>An early attempt at a ‘serif’ font for Quikscript. The letters appear to have been created by cutting and pasting pieces from an existing typeface.  Unfortunately, details such as variations in stroke width and the placement of serifs, spurs and ball terminals seem unrelated to the way letters are handwritten, unlike in traditional Roman typefaces. The non-Quikscript characters are from the version of Times (New Roman) that accompanies macOS.</p>

<p class="lhfix">An original geometric-style font. For a geometric face, it is lacking in consistency of letter shapes and vertical alignment. Other oddities are <span class="qs"></span>, which bears no resemblance to its recognised form, and that the angled brackets are of the sort used in mathematical notation, not Quikscript. The numerals and punctuation appear to have been lifted from Futura. Nearly-unique ASCII character mapping, shared only with Quickscript Georgian (see below).</p>

<p>A font apparently made from chopped-up parts of Microsoft’s typeface, Georgia. The result is much better than Jeremy but does suffer from some of the same problems.</p>

<p>A customised version of Kingsley, as used in the document <cite>Quikscript as I use it</cite> (available on the Yahoo! Group). It contains added ligatures and diacritical marks for recording syllable stress and syllabic consonants. The character encoding has been tweaked further—enough for me to consider it a new encoding. The quotation marks and Pound and Euro signs—which I believe should be mandatory for all new fonts—come courtesy of Comic Sans. </p>
