<h2>Utilities</h2>

<p>These tools can help with producing Quikscript texts by computer. I originally started this project as a Lua script, but switched to HTML/Javascript as the result would be significantly more user-friendly: everyone already has a web browser, eliminating the need to install additional software; and it allows for easier development of a visual user interface. The programs below don’t require an internet connection to work; feel free to download them to your computer (right-click and choose “Save target as...” or the option to that effect).</p>

<p>These programs work best in conjunction with a modern <a href="typing.html">keyboard entry method</a> for Quikscript. Furthermore, since they operate offline, you must have a <a href="otherfonts.html">Quikscript font</a> installed on your machine to view any Unicode PUA text.</p>

<h3><a href="qstc.html">QSTC (Quikscript Transcoder)</a></h3>

<p>This tool can convert Quikscript texts between the various encoding schemes that have been used over the years. This is especially important when considering that early Quikscript fonts employed custom, and often unique, encodings which doubled as a solution of sorts to the keyboard entry problem (See the <a href="typing.html#encodings">character encodings section</a> of the Typing page for further details). Therefore, if you have any old computer-based Quikscript material you wish to resurrect (or new material to set in an old font), QSTC may be of help.</p>

<!--<h3><a href="qstl.html">QSTL (Quikscript Transliterator)</a></h3>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, this tool can convert conventional English texts using the Latin alphabet into Quikscript. It works by performing word-for-word swaps using a user-defined dictionary. Consequently, it can actually convert texts to just about any script or orthography; making it perfectly suited for conversion to Shavian, the Deseret Alphabet, British/American (or other reformed) spellings and more.</p>-->
