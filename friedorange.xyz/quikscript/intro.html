<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Quikscript is an alternative alphabet specially designed for the English language. It consists of 40 new letters: one for each spoken sound. Not only does this allow for logical spellings, unlike the old 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, but texts require significantly fewer letters to write this way. Each Quikscript letter is written with a single penstroke, reducing the labour of handwriting even further:</p>

</figure>

<p>This website contains resources for learning the alphabet and its history, including the original <cite>Quikscript Manual</cite> by its developer, Kingsley Read. It also showcases the fonts and computer input methods that have been created to support Quikscript, by myself and other enthusiasts. On this page, you will find a (greatly condensed) summary of those learning resources. As a matter of fact, you can start using Quikscript right now with the information below. You can always see the Resources page for thorough explanations of the general concepts, and any finer details not discussed here.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Quikscript evolved from Shavian, or the Shaw Alphabet, in the 1960s. Shavian had been developed at the request of the famous writer, George Bernard Shaw. He used his Will to call for a worldwide competition to design a better English alphabet, and leave money to the cause. This was prompted by the absurdity of many English spellings, and the immense wastage of time and space caused by having to write single sounds with multiple Latin letters. It was reasoned that our conventional spellings were so ingrained—practically sacred—that the public would never accept a major spelling reform, so an entirely new alphabet was needed. This provided an opportunity to make other improvements at the same time, such as simpler and more varied letter shapes to make reading and writing easier.</p>

<h3>About the name</h3>

<p>The alphabet and each of its letters have been given <a href="names.html">different names</a> by different people over the years. The names used throughout these pages are those which seem to be commonly accepted in the online community today.</p>

<h2>The Quikscript alphabet</h2>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="lhfix">
	<li>*<span class="qs"></span> is mostly used for the <strong>schwa</strong> sound /ə/ (also called the reduced, weak or indeterminate vowel), but also represents /ʌ/ as in <span class="qs"></span> “h<u>u</u>t”, and /ɜː/ as in <span class="qs" style="font-feature-settings: 'liga' 0;"></span> “h<u>u</u>rt”.</li>
	<li>For the /ɛər/ sound in p<u>air</u>, d<u>are</u>, th<u>ere</u>, pr<u>ayer</u>, etc. write <span class="qs"></span>.</li>
	<li>An equivalent of <span class="qs"></span> was not present in the original Shaw Alphabet because, even at the time, that sound was largely extinct. As a result, some Quikscript users consider this letter to be optional.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing tips</h3>

<p class="lhfix">See the way <strong>short</strong> letters sit between the baseline and waistline, like our conventional a, m, x; <strong>tall</strong> letters rise above the waistline like b, f, h; and <strong>deep</strong> letters go below the baseline like g, j, q. This feature was included to help with <a rel="external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/develop/word-recognition">word recognition</a>, according to the conventional wisdom of the time.</p>

<p>The general rule for writing the letters is to <strong>finish rightwardly</strong>. This does mean that some letters should be written bottom-to-top, which may take some getting used to.</p>

<p class="lhfix">Following this, you may notice that a letter often ends right where the next would begin. In such situations, there is no need to leave a gap between letters; many sequences like <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span> may be written in a single motion. Entire words like <span class="qs"></span> “kindly” or <span class="qs"></span> “beaver” can be completely continuous. Do not write additional connecting strokes between letters, as in conventional cursive.</p>

<p class="lhfix">There are <strong>no capital letters</strong> in Quikscript! To mark proper names and to refer to letters, used a raised dot, for example: <span class="qs">·</span> “James”, <span class="qs">·</span> “Rome”, <span class="qs">·</span> “Pipe”. Write a dot after each letter in abbreviations like <span class="qs">...</span> “ATM” and <span class="qs">·...</span> “USA” as in conventional all-capitals text. Like in conventional handwriting, use <u>underlining</u> for emphasis.</p>

<p>Brackets, or parentheses, should be <strong>angled</strong> or [square] and not (round) as those resemble Quikscript letters.</p>

<h3>Spelling tips</h3>

<p class="lhfix"><strong>Always</strong> write <span class="qs"></span> wherever r occurs in the Latin alphabet, even if you wouldn’t pronounce it there with your accent.</p>

<p class="lhfix"><strong>Do not</strong> write double letters in words like <span class="qs"></span> “bottle”. Of course, <strong>do</strong> write them when they are both actually pronounced, as  in <span class="qs"></span> “unknown” and <span class="qs"></span> “teammate”.</p>

<p class="lhfix">Many North American speakers have trouble distinguishing <span class="qs"></span>, <span class="qs"></span>, and <span class="qs"></span>. If this applies to you, just remember to use <span class="qs"></span> in words like <u>or</u>, c<u>our</u>t, b<u>oar</u>d, w<u>ar</u> and <span class="qs"></span> in <u>a</u>re, p<u>al</u>m, f<u>a</u>ther, h<u>ea</u>rt. Strictly speaking, <span class="qs"></span> is used for <u>awe</u>, <u>a</u>ll, c<u>augh</u>t, b<u>ough</u>t, and <span class="qs"></span> for the “short o” sound in c<u>o</u>t, w<u>a</u>nd, <u>e</u>ns<u>e</u>mble<!--(I spell my screen name with <span class="qs"></span> as that’s how I pronounce it with my accent)-->; but don’t worry if you can’t hear the difference. <strong>If in doubt, use <span class="qs"></span>,</strong> as it is the vowel usually spoken in America. <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span> are jarring to read when used incorrectly.</p>

<p class="lhfix">Another commonly confused pair of letters is <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span>: the difference is obvious in words like <span class="qs"></span> “filled” and <span class="qs"></span> “field”. But their precise sound values may vary, or even overlap in certain accents. It is most important to distinguish them based on <strong>syllable stress</strong> (emphasis): for example, you can hear the difference between <span class="qs"></span> “appear” and <span class="qs"></span> “happier”, or <span class="qs"></span> “daisy” and <span class="qs">· </span> “<cite>Day Z</cite>”.</p>

<h3>Standard abbreviations</h3>

<p class="lhfix">Some of the shortest and commonest words are pronounced differently depending on context—like <i>the</i>; <span class="qs"></span> or <span class="qs"></span>—or tend to have an indistinct or “weak” pronunciation, like <i>and</i>, <i>of</i>, <i>to</i>, etc. In Quikscript, such words may be written with a single letter, keeping the spellings consistent while saving much valuable time and space:</p>
<table class="decorated" style="margin-top: 1em;">
<tr>
	<td>the</td>
	<td>of</td>
	<td>and</td>
	<td>to</td>
	<td>it</td>
	<td>is</td>
	<td>for</td>
	<td>be</td>
</tr>
<tr class="qs">
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
	<td></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="lhfix">We are already accustomed to the abbreviations Mr, Mrs/Ms and Dr in the Latin alphabet; in Quikscript we write <span class="qs">&#xe680;</span>, <span class="qs">&#xe681;</span> and <span class="qs">&#xe682;</span> respectively (it is easier to write the three letters, all connected, for <u>D</u>oct<u>or</u>). Early Quikscript writers soon developed <span class="qs"></span> for <i>et cetera</i> (etc. or &amp;c.). More suggested contractions of very common words are listed in the <cite>Quikscript Manual</cite>, but these are purely optional.</p>

<h3>Special letters</h3>

<p>These four letters are not part of the alphabet proper, but were mentioned in the <i>Quikscript Manual</i> to enable certain sounds to be spelt or to better &ldquo;compete&rdquo; with the Latin alphabet for economy:</p>

<ul class="lhfix">
	<li><span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span> may be required for Scottish and Welsh place names, etc. <span class="qs"></span> may also be used for interjections like u<u>gh</u>, if you feel that <span class="qs"></span> would not be strong enough.</li>
	<li><span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span> are optional. When used, they replace <span class="qs"></span> and <span class="qs"></span>, but only where the letter X occurs conventionally.</li>
