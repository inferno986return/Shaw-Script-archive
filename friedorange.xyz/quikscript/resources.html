<h2>Learn</h2>

<p>These documents contain a wealth of information about Quikscript. They are intended as self-teaching guides and may be used to learn almost all there is to know about the alphabet. The rest involves using Quikscript on computers, which is covered on the other pages of this site.</p>

From <a rel="external" href="files/AndroclesAndTheLionOCR.pdf">The Shaw Alphabet Edition of <cite>Androcles and the Lion</cite></a>, pp. 9-16 & 143-152<br>
By C.R. Sopwith, Sir James Pitman, Peter MacCarthy, and Kingsley Read, 1962</p>
<p>This excerpt from <cite>Androcles and the Lion</cite> pertains to the original Shavian (Shaw) Alphabet. It explains the context behind its creation and the methodology of spelling used in the transliteration. It also provides advice for newcomers that should still be helpful to Quikscript enthusiasts.</p>

<p><a href="files/QuikscriptManualOCR.pdf">Quikscript: its Alphabet and Manual</a><br>
By Ronald Kingsley Read, 1966</p>
<p>The “Quikscript Manual” is the authoritative source of information on this newer alphabet. It begins with a review on the topic of spelling reform, and provides the rationale for the decisions behind Quikscript's design. It contains all the information needed for the absolute beginner to learn the alphabet, explaining in detail how to write the letters and defining conventions on spelling and abbreviation. Comprehensive visual examples are provided for the concepts taught. There are several pages of text in both the basic “Junior” and advanced “Senior” forms of Quikscript for reading practice.</p>

<p><a href="files/SecondShawAlphabetOCR.pdf">Second Shaw Alphabet</a><br>
From the Surprise Edition of <cite>Cole’s Funny Picture Book No. 2</cite>, pp. 172-197<br>
By Cole Turnley, 1977</p>
<p class="lhfix"><cite>Cole’s Funny Picture Book</cite> is a classic Australian children’s book, which was originally compiled in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, by the well-known eccentric publisher E.W. Cole. Its later editor, Cole Turnley, added an extensive section on Quikscript in a new, “Surprise” edition of the second volume in the 1970s. The article is written (and illustrated) with more of a focus on fun and aesthetics, to help spark the imagination in younger readers. It does contain some innovations on Turnley’s part, including: the new name <i>Second Shaw</i>, new letter names, a half-letter <span class="qs"></span>, and the borrowing of Shavian letter 𐑑 as an abbreviation for “that”. The piece is printed with side-by-side columns of Quikscript and Conventional text, providing reading material in a different style of handwriting from the <cite>Manual</cite>.</p>

<h3>Quick reference</h3>

<p>These quick reference sheets neatly fill an A4 page with key information. They should be useful for Quikscript users both beginning and experienced!</p>

<p><a href="files/KR_1969-12-18.pdf">Writing circle letter</a><br>
From Kingsley Read, dated 18<sup>th</sup> December 1969</p>
<p>This letter consists of four pages of Senior Quikscript, handwritten by Kingsley Read, so the style matches that of the <cite>Quikscript Manual</cite>. In it, he mainly discusses the Welsh orthography and the board game Go, amongst replies to group members on other topics. I found it archived on the Quikscript Yahoo! Group, with somewhat low-resolution, monochrome images that were heavily affected by JPEG compression. I cleaned it up as much as possible before making it available here.</p>

<p>This Minecraft resource pack adds two ‘languages’ to the game: Shavian and Quikscript. It contains additional Minecraft-format fonts (which are essentially conversions of my font, <a href="myfonts.html">QS Matrix Screen</a>) to support both alphabets, plus complete transliterations of every text string in the game. I named it ShawCraft to take advantage of the wider recognition of the original Shaw Alphabet.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>This also works on versions 1.13 and up, even though Minecraft warns of incompatibility. Versions prior to 1.16 only support Quikscript, due to Shavian’s use of Unicode characters from the Supplementary Multilingual Plane. Be aware that on older versions, some text strings will be different or missing.</li>
	<li>The splash text, credits and end poem are not converted, since those aren’t affected by the game’s language setting.</li>
</ul>

<section id="footnotes">

	<li>Several cases have been omitted where a pronunciation applies only to certain dialects. Furthermore, many of the listed consonant spellings have further variations ending in e; as in finesse, femme, have, cigarette, etc. Likewise, there are additional vowel spellings containing e; as in rate, yoke, site, etc. Most such cases have been omitted for brevity. I do not expect this will cause much confusion. After all, one of the first things we are told when learning to read is that e is often ‘silent’ or ‘bossy’ (<i>i.e.</i> affects the pronunciation of a nearby vowel letter). Finally, some other cases that are very rare or unique are not listed. As always, if the commonly accepted pronunciation is known, choosing a Quikscript spelling will be straightforward.</li>
