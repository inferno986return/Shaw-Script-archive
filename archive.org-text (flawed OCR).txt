FOREWORD 

BY THE PUBLIC TRUSTEE 

Bernard Shaw died on 2 November 1950 and his 
Will, by which he appointed the Public Trustee to be 
executor and trustee, contained provisions for a new 
‘Proposed British Alphabet’, a subject in which he always 
had a great interest. 

Shaw imposed on his trustee the duty of seeking and 
publishing a more efficient alphabet of at least forty 
letters than the existing one of twenty-six letters to 
enable ‘the said language to be written without indicating 
single sounds by groups of letters or by diacritical marks’. 
The Public Trustee was also directed to 

employ a phonetic expert to transliterate my play entitled 
Androcles and the Lion into the proposed British Alphabet 
assuming the pronunciation to resemble that recorded of His 
Majesty our late King George V and sometimes described as 
Northern English; to employ an artist calligrapher to copy the 
transliteration for reproduction by lithography, photography or 
any other method that may serve in the absence of printers’ 
types; to advertise and publish the transliteration with the 
original Doctor Johnson’s lettering opposite the transliteration 
page by page and a glossary of the two alphabets at the end and 
to present copies to public libraries in the British Isles, the 
British Commonwealth, the American States North and South 
and to national libraries everywhere in that order. 

Shaw directed his trustee 

to bear in mind that the proposed British Alphabet does not 
pretend to be exhaustive as it" contains only sixteen vowels 
whereas by infinitesimal movements of the tongue countless 
different vowels can be produced all of them in use among 
speakers of English who utter the same vowels no oftener than 
they make the same fingerprints.

FOREWORD 


Shaw’s residuary estate was directed to be held for a 
period on certain trusts for these purposes, but such 
purposes were declared by a Judge of the Chancery Divi¬ 
sion of the High Court of Justice in England to be invalid 
in law. The Public Trustee appealed from this decision, 
and by way of compromise the British Museum, the 
Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the National 
Gallery of Ireland (who in default of the alphabet pro¬ 
visions in the Will were entitled to the residuary estate) 
agreed to pay a certain sum to the Public Trustee to be 
applied in furtherance of the Alphabet trusts. 

At the end of 1957 the Public Trustee let it be known 
that he would award a prize of £500 f° r the design of a 
new alphabet complying most nearly with the provisions 
of Shaw’s Will. 

In the course of 1958 about 450 designs were sub¬ 
mitted from all parts of the world. 

On New Year’s Eve 1959 the Public Trustee an¬ 
nounced that there did not appear to be one outstanding 
design which might with confidence be said to be as 
satisfactory as what might be achieved by further effort 
and that he was not prepared at that time to single out 
one as the new Alphabet to be adopted for the purposes 
of the Will. There were, however, four designers who 
were judged to be of such outstanding merit that the 
prize money of £500 was divided equally between them, 
thus closing the competition. Those four designers were 
Mrs Pauline M. Barrett (of Canada), Mr J. F. Magrath, 
Dr S. L. Pugmire, and Mr Kingsley Read. 

The Public Trustee then asked an expert in this field 
to collaborate with one or all of the four designers men¬ 
tioned above to produce the best possible alphabet as is 
envisaged by Shaw’s Will. The result is the design which 
appears in the Key on page 151 and on the detachable 


bookmark between pages 16 and 17 and which has been 
applied in this publication. 

In authorizing the publication of this book the Public 
Trustee gratefully acknowledges the encouragement he 
has received from a large number of correspondents 
throughout the world but must single out for special 
mention the technical advice given by Mr Alan T. 
Dodson formerly of H.M. Stationery Office, and by 
Mr Peter MacCarthy of the Department of Phonetics at 
Leeds University, and to the latter he is also indebted 
for the transliteration now published. He also thanks all 
the very many designers, particularly Mrs Barrett, 
Mr Magrath, and Dr Pugmire, whose own designs and 
observations contributed so much to helping the Public 
Trustee to make a final choice. He is especially grateful, 
however, to Mr Kingsley Read, whose design has been 
adopted and to whose typographic artistry the trans¬ 
literation in this book is its own tribute.

INTRODUCTION 
TO SHAW’S ALPHABET 


Here is Shaw’s alphabet. It has been proved that those 
who wish to read it can do so after only a few hours of 
concentrated deciphering. 

Why should anyone wish to use it? And why should 
there be any departure from the familiar forms of the 
Roman alphabet in which English is printed and 
written? 

You will notice from the comparisons that Shaw’s 
alphabet is both more legible and one-third more econo¬ 
mical in space than traditional printing, and this should 
lead to a great increase in reading speed. The characters 
themselves are very distinct. To prove them more legible, 
open the book and hold it upside down in front of a 
mirror. Both mirrored pages will thus become equally 
unfamiliar. Keep the back of the book pressed against 
your lips, and advance towards the mirror until you are 
able to see individual characters clearly enough to be able 
to copy them. Note that the Shaw characters are clearly 
seen at a greater distance. 

The economy in space and greater simplicity of charac¬ 
ters ought also to increase the speed and ease of writing - 
even more than it does the ease of reading. Many of the 
characters easily join into pairs and trios to form syllables 
which recur frequently in English words; the sounds of 
the language are completely characterized, thus per¬ 
mitting abbreviation with great reliability. Shaw found 
traditional script too laborious, and Pitman’s shorthand 
too economical. Though at this time we can only 
guess, it is probable that an abbreviated handwriting 
speed of 60-100 words a minute, with complete reliability 


12 


INTRODUCTION 


of reading, will be possible for those who attain ‘auto¬ 
matic’ facility with Shaw’s alphabet. In other words, 
reading may be 50-75 per cent, and writing 80-100 per 
cent faster, and even 200-300 per cent, by using simple 
abbreviations. 

Shaw insisted that, unless his alphabet were to offer 
the substantial advantages he himself desired, there 
would be no reason for adding to the existing media of 


communication, which include: typewriting, shorthand, 
morse, semaphore, and braille, in addition to the Roman 
alphabet which is itself represented by three quite 
different sets of signs (as in ‘alphabet’, ‘alphabet’, and 
a(j)/ia('et ). 


The Key on page 151 (duplicated on the bookmark) 
will enable you to achieve the beginnings of skill and the 
satisfaction of success within three or four hours. 


Although this means starting from scratch, remember 
that Isaac Pitman, whose shorthand Shaw used for all his 


writings, also did so with a system offering the same 
advantages as Shaw’s alphabet: that is, the saving of time, 
effort, and money. 

Shaw did not want you and me to abandon the Roman 
alphabet. The long-established Roman figures (1,11,111, 
IV,V,VI, vii,viii,ix) remain even after the Arabic figures 
(the newer and handier 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) have found 
favour. We now use both, with greater convenience. 
The new figures were not imposed, nor the old sup¬ 
planted. Similarly, Shaw believed, uses would be found 
for a new and handier alphabet without abandoning the 


old one. 


If those who tried it found it advantageous, they would 
use it, and by their example it would gain what following 
it deserved. If its benefits were substantial enough, it 
would spread and establish itself through merit - as 


13 



INTRODUCTION 


Arabic numerals did despite the then complete satisfac¬ 
tion with Roman numerals. 

Utilitarian advantage is thus the principle governing 
the new alphabet. Shaw was unique in pointing out that 
substantial economy could be attained only (a) if the 
designer were to depart from a system evolved by the 
Romans 2,000 years ago for carving their public notices 
in stone; ( b ) if a single set of alphabetical characters were 
used - abolishing the different look of words in capitals, 
small letters, and linked handwritten letters; and ( c) if 
each distinct sound of the language were spelt with its 
own unvarying character. 

These three factors in designing, taken together, made 
a non-Roman alphabet essential. Of course, there is 
nothing revolutionary in that. There are hundreds of 
non-Roman alphabets - and there are several variations 
within the Roman alphabet, e.g. 

( HERE IS A SENTENCE 
here is a sentence 
(1 ere is a sentence 

Greek r\p t? a oevrevs 

Russian up hc a ceHTeHC 

Thus these four English words may already be repre¬ 
sented in a number of existing alphabets. 

Those who know Greek and English, Russian and 
English, etc., will have no difficulty in reading that 
sentence immediately in as many alphabets as they 
know - and it is considered at school that once a child 
has learned his A, B, C, D he is well placed to learn also 
his a, b, c, d, his a, f>, c, d, his a, fi, y, S (Greek), and his 
a, 6, b, r (Russian). 

Only a few hours will be needed to persuade you that 
the new alphabet has the potential advantages Shaw 




INTRODUCTION 


intended for it. At first you will read and write it in a 
plodding childlike way, as you once did Roman. Much 
more rapidly than a child’s, your familiarity and ease will 
grow, until the use of Shaw’s alphabet becomes as natural 
and automatic as your use of Roman - but faster. 

In personal and intimate writing the forty-eight 
(40 -f- 8) characters of the Shaw alphabet may faithfully 
portray the pronunciation of the individual; but, as Shaw 
pointed out, too eccentric a dialect may hamper, and 
even destroy, effective communication. He considered 
that, though there was no need to standardize writing if 
not intended for publication, there was every need for 
conformity in print; standard spellings being particularly 
desirable when that print is intended for circulation 
throughout the English-speaking world. 

In his Will, Shaw specified just such a standardization 
for this play. He laid down for it a ‘pronunciation to 
resemble that recorded of His Majesty our late King 
George V and sometimes described as Northern English’. 
He was an expert in stage direction and, so it may be 
supposed, considered this pronunciation to be the best 
basis for comprehension with acceptability in reading as 
he had found it to be in speech from the stage. 

But by all means write as you think fit, and leave 
experts to standardize printers’ spelling. 

This book costs very little. Get your friends to buy one 
and to learn the alphabet so that you can write to one 
another - or, if you become so skilled that you no longer 
need to ‘keep your eye in’, give it away.

INTRODUCTION 


note: I have offered, if there is the demand, to organize 
what were known as ‘ever-circulators’ in the early days 
of my grandfather. Send me a letter in Shaw’s alphabet, 
mentioning your particular interests or circumstances. 
Give me your name and address in ordinary writing on 
an enclosed envelope. I will then try to arrange ‘circles’ 
of five or six who, drawn together in a friendship by 
Shaw’s alphabet, will all circulate their own letters to 
which each in turn will add. 

I have also offered, if there is a demand, to get further 
material published in the Shaw alphabet. When you have 
learnt to read and write fluently, and want more than 
your ever-circulator correspondence to read, please 
write to me, Sir James Pitman, k.b.e., m.p., at the 
House of Commons, London, S.W. i, England, saying 
which of Shaw’s works or other literature you would 
like to read in a printed transcription. I can make no 
promises - other than to consider your suggestions most 
sympathetically. Meanwhile, if anyone wishes to get 
printed their own material in Shaw’s alphabet, they are 
permitted to do so, since the copyright for the alphabet 
and for the type-faces is public property. Messrs Stephen 
Austin & Sons, Ltd, of Caxton Hill, Ware Road, 
Hertford, England, hold a supply of the types and are 
willing to undertake the work. For the moment, type 
available is confined to 12-point size in the three founts 
exemplified in this book.

TYPOGRAPHY 
AND READING KEY 

The orthodox version of the play appears on right-hand 
pages. On the left is a line-for-line equivalent in the 
Shaw Alphabet, which occupies one-third less space, 
though both versions are set in type of the same size. 

Three styles of type are used — to distinguish between 
the dialogue words spoken (‘Normal’ style), the names 
of speakers (‘Bold’), and the scattered stage directions 
(‘Sloping’). 

As readers should first become accustomed to Normal 
type, this style is used for lengthy stage directions intro¬ 
ducing the Prologue and each Act. The ‘Shavian’ text’s 
stage directions are all placed within brackets [] irrespec¬ 
tive of what is done with them in the orthodox text. 

To help unpractised readers, many apostrophes 
omitted in the orthodox version are restored in this 
Shavian text; but any negative verb (dont, wouldnt etc) 
is transcribed without an apostrophe. 

Emphasis is indicated by the use of bold type. 

To convert letters into sounds, look for any Tall letter 
in the Reading Key’s first line, for any Deep letter in the 
second line, for any Short letter in the lower lines. Only 
the last letter of all is a Tall-and-Short compound. 

The reader will find the Key’s top edge a handy guide 
from the line he is deciphering to its ‘crib-line’ opposite. 

Notes on the spelling are given on page 143.

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 


PROLOGUE 

Overture: forest sounds, roaring of lions, Christ¬ 
ian hymn faintly. 

A jungle path. A lion’s roar, a melancholy 
suffering roar, comes from the jungle. It is 
repeated nearer. The lion limps from the jungle on 
three legs, holding up his right forepaw, in which a 
huge thorn sticks. He sits down and contemplates it. 
He licks it. He shakes it. He tries to extract 
it by scraping it along the ground, and hurts 
himself worse. He roars piteously. He licks it 
again. Tears drop from his eyes. He limps painfully 
off the path and lies down under the trees, exhausted 
with pain. Heaving a long sigh, like wind in a trombone, 
he goes to sleep. 

Androcles and his wife Megaera come along the 
path. He is a small, thin, ridiculous little man 
who might be any age from thirty to fifty-five. He 
has sandy hair, watery compassionate blue eyes, 
sensitive nostrils, and a very presentable forehead; 
but his good points go no further: his arms and 
legs and back, though wiry of their kind, look shrivelled 
and starved. He carries a big bundle, is very poorly 
clad, and seems tired and hungry. 

His wife is a rather handsome pampered slattern, 
well fed and in the prime of life. She has nothing to 
carry, and has a stout stick to help her along.

megaera [ suddenly throwing down her stick\ I wont

androcles [pleading wearily ] Oh, not again, dear. 
Whats the good of stopping every two miles and 
saying you wont go another step ? We must get on 
to the next village before night. There are wild 
beasts in this wood: lions, they say. 

MEGAERA. I dont believe a word of it. You are 
always threatening me with wild beasts to make 
me walk the very soul out of my body when 
I can hardly drag one foot before another. We 
havnt seen a single lion yet. 

androcles. Well, dear, do you want to see one? 

megaera \tearing the bundle from his back ] You 
cruel brute, you dont care how tired I am, or 
what becomes of me f she throws the bundle on the 
ground ]: always thinking of yourself. Self! self! 
self! always yourself! [She sits down on the 
bundle ]. 

androcles [sitting down sadly on the ground with 
his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands ] 
We all have to think of ourselves occasionally, 
dear. 

megaera. A man ought to think of his wife 
sometimes. 

androcles. He cant always help it, dear. You 
make me think of you a good deal. Not that 
I blame you. 

megaera. Blame me! I should think not indeed. 
Is it my fault that I’m married to you? 

androcles. No, dear: that is my fault.

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

megaera. Thats a nice thing to say to me. Arnt 
you happy with me? 
androcles. I elont complain, my love. 
megaera. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. 
androcles. I am, my dear. 
megaera. Youre not: you glory in it. 
androcles. In what, darling? 
megaera. In everything. In making me a slave, 
and making yourself a laughing-stock. It’s not 
fair. You get me the name of being a shrew with 
your meek ways, always talking as if butter 
wouldnt melt in your mouth. And just because 
I look a big strong woman, and because I’m 
goodhearted and a bit hasty, and because youre 
always driving me to do things I’m sorry for 
afterwards, people say ‘Poor man: what a life his 
wife leads him!’ Oh, if they only knew! And you 
think I dont know. But I do, I do, [ screaming] 
I do. 

androcles. Yes, my dear: I know you do. 
megaera. Then why dont you treat me properly 
and be a good husband to me? 
androcles. What can I do, my dear? 
megaera. What can you do! You can return to 
your duty, and come back to your home and 
your friends, and sacrifice to the gods as all 
respectable people do, instead of having us 
hunted out of house and home for being dirty 
disreputable blaspheming atheists. 
androcles. I’m not an atheist, dear: I am a 
Christian.

androcles. Just like us, dear. 
megaera. Speak for yourself. Dont you dare to 
compare me to common people. My father 
owned his own public-house; and sorrowful was 
the day for me when you first came drinking in 
our bar. 

androcles. I confess I was addicted to it, dear. 

But I gave it up when I became a Christian. 
megaera. Youd much better have remained a 
drunkard. I can forgive a man being addicted to 
drink: it’s only natural; and I dont deny I like a 
drop myself sometimes. What I cant stand is your 
being addicted to Christianity. And whats worse 
again, your being addicted to animals. How is any 
woman to keep her house clean when you bring in 
every stray cat and lost cur and lame duck in the 
whole countryside? You took the bread out of my 
mouth to feed them: you know you did: dont 
attempt to deny it. 

androcles. Only when they were hungry and 
you were getting too stout, dearie. 
megaera. Yes: insult me, do. [ Rising ] Oh! I 
wont bear it another moment. You used to sit and 
talk to those dumb brute beasts for hours, when 
you hadnt a word for me. 
androcles. They never answered back, darling.

your own wife, you can live with them here in the

jungle. Ive had enough of them and enough of you. 
I’m going back. I’m going home. 

ANDROCLES \barring the way back\ No, dearie: 
dont take on like that. We cant go back. Weve 
sold everything: we should starve; and I should 
be sent to Rome and thrown to the lions - 
megaera. Serve you right! I wish the lions joy of 
you. \Screaming] Are you going to get out of my 
way and let me go home? 
androcles. No, dear - 

megaera. Then I’ll make my way through the 
forest; and when I’m eaten by the wild beasts 
youll know what a wife youve lost. [She dashes 
into the jungle and nearly falls over the sleeping 
lion]. Oh! Oh! Andy! Andy! [She totters back 
and collapses into the arms of Androcles, who, 
crushed by her weight, falls on his bundle], 
androcles [extracting himself from beneath 
her and slapping her hands in great anxiety] What 
is it, my precious, my pet? Whats the matter? 
[He raises her head. Speechless with terror, she 
points in the direction of the sleeping lion. He 
steals cautiously towards the spot indicated by 
Megaera. She rises zvith an effort and totters 
after him]. 

megaera. No, Andy: youll be killed. Come back. 

The lion utters a long snoring sigh. 
Androcles sees the lion, and recoils fainting 
into the arms of Megaera, who falls back on the 
bundle. They roll apart and lie staring in terror 
at one another. The lion is heard groaning 
heavily in the jungle.

megaera [ despairing ] The gods have sent him to 
punish us because youre a Christian. Take me 
away, Andy. Save me. 

androcles [rising] Meggy: theres one chance 
for you. Itll take him pretty nigh twenty minutes 
to eat me (I’m rather stringy and tough) and you 
can escape in less time than that. 
megaera. Oh, dont talk about eating. [77ze lion 
rises with a great groan and limps towards them]. 
Oh! [She faints], 

ANDROCLES [ quaking , hut keeping between the 
lion and Megaera] Dont you come near my wife, 
do you hear? [ The lion groans. Androcles can 
hardly stand for trembling]. Meggy: run. Run 
for your life. If I take my eye off him, it’s all 
up. [ The lion holds up his wounded paw and 
flaps it piteously before Androcles], Oh, he’s 
lame, poor old chap! He’s got a thorn in his paw. 
A frightfully big thorn. [Full of sympathy] Oh, 
poor old man! Did um get an awful thorn into 
urn’s tootsums wootsums? Has it made um too 
sick to eat a nice little Christian man for urn’s 
breakfast? Oh, a nice little Christian man will 
get urn’s thorn out for um; and then um shall eat 
the nice Christian man and the nice Christian 
man’s nice big tender wifey pifey. [The lion re¬ 
sponds by moans of self-pity]. Yes, yes, yes, 
yes, yes. Now, now [taking the pazu in his hand], 
um is not to bite and not to scratch, not even if it 
hurts a very very little. Now make velvet paws. 
Thats right. [He pulls gingerly at the thorn. The

lion, zvith an angry yell of pain, jerks back 
his pazv so abruptly that Androcles is thrown 
on his back]. Steadeee! Oh, did the nasty cruel 
little Christian man hurt the sore paw? [The lion 
moans assentingly but apologetically]. Well, 
one more little pull and it will be all over. Just 
one little, little, leetle pull; and then urn will live 
happily ever after. [He gives the thorn another 
pull. The lion roars and snaps his jaws with a 
terrifying clash]. Oh, mustnt frighten urn’s good 
kind doctor, urn’s affectionate nursey. That didnt 
hurt at all: not a bit. Just one more. Just to 
shew how the brave big lion can bear pain, not 
like the little crybaby Christian man. Oopsh! [The 
thorn comes out. The lion yells zvith pain, and 
shakes his pazv wildly], Thats it! [Holding up 
the thorn]. Nowit’s out. Now lick urn’s paw to take 
away the nasty inflammation. See? [He licks his 
own hand. The lion nods intelligently and licks 
his paw industriously]. Clever little liony- 
piony! Understands urn’s dear old friend Andy 
Wandy. [The lion licks his face]. Yes, kissums 
Andy Wandy. f The lion wagging his tail 
violently, rises on his hind legs, and 
embraces Androcles, who makes a wry face and 
cries] Velvet paws! Velvet paws! [The lion drazvs 
in his claws]. Thats right. [He embraces the 
lion, zvho finally takes the end of his tail in 
one paw, places that tight round Androcles' 
waist, resting it on his hip. Androcles

Evening. The end of three converging roads to Rome. 
Three triumphal arches span them where they debouch 
on a square at the gate of the city. Looking north through 
the arches one can see the campagna threaded by the 
three long dusty tracks. On the east and west sides of 
the square are long stone benches. A?i old beggar 
sits on the east side, his bozvl at his feet. 

Through the eastern arch a squad of Roman soldiers 
tramps along escorting a batch of Christian prisoners 
of both sexes and all ages, among them one 
Lavinia, a good-looking resolute young woman, 
apparently of higher social standing than her fellow- 
prisoners. A centurion, carrying his vinewood 
cudgel, trudges alongside the squad, on its right, in 
command of it. All are tired and dusty; but the 
soldiers are dogged and indifferent, the Christians 
lighthearted and determined to treat their hardships as 
a joke and encourage one another. 

A bugle is heard far behind on the road, where 
the rest of the cohort is following. 

centurion [stopping] Halt! Orders from the 
Captain. [They halt and wait]. Now then, you 
Christians, none of your larks. The captain’s com¬ 
ing. Mind you behave yourselves. No singing. 
Look respectful. Look serious, if youre capable 
of it. See that big building over there! Thats the 
Coliseum. Thats where youll be thrown to the 
lions or set to fight the gladiators presently. Think 
of that; and itll help you to behave properly before

the captain. [The Captain arrives ]. Attention! 
Salute! [ The soldiers salute]. 

A Christian [ cheerfully ] God bless you, Captain! 

centurion [scandalized] Silence! 

The Captain, a patrician, handsome, about 
thirty-five, very cold and distinguished, very 
superior and authoritative, steps up on a stone 
seat at the west side of the square, behind the 
centurion, so as to dominate the others more 
effectually. 

the captain. Centurion. 

centurion [standing at attention and saluting] 
Sir? 

the captain [speaking stiffly and off dally] You 
will remind your men, Centurion, thatwearenow 
entering Rome. You will instruct them that once 
inside the gates of Rome they are in the presence 
of the Emperor. You will make them understand 
that the lax discipline of the march cannot be per¬ 
mitted here. You will instruct them to shave every 
day, not every week. You will impress on them 
particularly that there must be an end to the pro¬ 
fanity and blasphemy of singing Christian hymns 
on the march. I have to reprimand you, Cen¬ 
turion, for not only allowing this, but actually 
doing it yourself. 

centurion [apologetic] The men march better, 
Captain. 

the captain. No doubt. For that reason an 
exception is made in the case of the march called 
Onward Christian Soldiers. This may be sung, 
except when marching through the forum or

centurion. Youll find out how funny it is when 
youre thrown to the lions tomorrow. [To the 
Captain, who looks displeased '] Beg pardon, sir. 
[To the Christians ] Silennnnce! 
the captain. You are to instruct your men that 
all intimacy with Christian prisoners must now 
cease. The men have fallen into habits of de¬ 
pendence upon the prisoners, especially the 
female prisoners, for cooking, repairs to uniforms, 
writing letters, and advice in their private affairs. 
In a Roman soldier such dependence is inad¬ 
missible. Let me see no more of it whilst we are 
in the city. Further, your orders are that in 
addressing Christian prisoners, the manners and 
tone of your men must express abhorrence and 
contempt. Any shortcoming in this respect will 
be regarded as a breach of discipline. [He turns to 
the prisoners ] Prisoners.

centurion [fiercely] Prisonerrrrrs! Tention! 
Silence! 

the captain. I call your attention, prisoners, to 
the fact that you may be called on to appear in the 
Imperial Circus at any time from tomorrow 
onwards according to the requirements of the 
managers. I may inform you that as there is a 
shortage of Christians just now, you may expect 
to be called on very soon. 
la vi n 1 A. What will they do to us, Captain? 
centurion. Silence! 

the captain. The women will be conducted into 
the arena with the wild beasts of the Imperial 
Menagerie, and will suffer the consequences. The 
men, if of an age to bear arms, will be given 
weapons to defend themselves, if they choose, 
against the Imperial Gladiators. 
la v 1NI A. Captain: is there no hope that this 
cruel persecution - 

centurion [shocked] Silence! Hold your tongue, 
there. Persecution, indeed! 
the captain [unmoved and somewhat sardonic] 
Persecution is not a term applicable to the 
acts of the Emperor. The Emperor is the De¬ 
fender of the Faith. In throwing you to the lions 
he will be upholding the interests of religion in 
Rome. If you were to throw him to the lions', that 
would no doubt be persecution. 

The Christians again laugh heartily. 
centurion [horrified] Silence, I tell you! 
Keep silence there. Did anyone ever hear the like 
of this?

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

lavinia. Captain: there will be nobody to appre¬ 
ciate your jokes when we are gone. 

the captain [unshaken in his official delivery ] 
I call the attention of the female prisoner Lavinia 
to the fact that as the Emperor is a divine 
personage, her imputation of cruelty is not 
only treason, but sacrilege. I point out to her 
further that there is no foundation for the charge, 
as the Emperor does not desire that any prisoner 
should suffer; nor can any Christian be harmed 
save through his or her own obstinacy. All that 
is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods: a simple 
and convenient ceremony effected by dropping 
a pinch of incense on the altar, after which the 
prisoner is at once set free. Under such circum¬ 
stances you have only your own perverse folly to 
blame if you suffer. I suggest to you that if you 
cannot burn a morsel of incense as a matter of 
conviction, you might at least do so as a matter 
of good taste, to avoid shocking the religious 
convictions of your fellow citizens. I am aware 
that these considerations do not weigh with 
Christians; but it is my duty to call your attention 
to them in order that you may have no ground 
for complaining of your treatment, or of accusing 
the Emperor of cruelty when he is shewing you 
the most signal clemency. Looked at from this 
point of view, every Christian who has perished 
in the arena has really committed suicide. 

lavinia. Captain: your jokes are too grim. Do not 
think it is easy for us to die. Our faith makes life 
far stronger and more wonderful in us than when

we walked in darkness and had nothing to live 
for. Death is harder for us than for you: the 
martyr’s agony is as bitter as his triumph is 
glorious. 

the captain [ rather troubled, addressing her per¬ 
sonally and gravely ] A martyr, Lavinia, is a fool. 
Your death will prove nothing. 
lavinia. Then why kill me? 
the captain. I mean that truth, if there be any 
truth, needs no martyrs. 

lavinia. No; but my faith, like your sword, needs 
testing. Can you test your sword except by 
staking your life on it? 

the captain [ suddenly resuming his official tone ] 
I call the attention of the female prisoner to the 
fact that Christians are not allowed to draw the 
Emperor’s officers into arguments and put 
questions to them for which the military regula¬ 
tions provide no answer. [ The Christians titter ]. 
lavinia. Captain: how can you? 
the captain. I call the female prisoner’s attention 
specially to the fact that four comfortable homes 
have been offered her by officers of this regiment, 
of which she can have her choice the moment 
she chooses to sacrifice as all wellbred Roman 
ladies do. I have no more to say to the prisoners. 
centurion. Dismiss! But stay where you are. 
the captain. Centurion: you will remain here 
with your men in charge of the prisoners until the 
arrival of three Christian prisoners in the custody 
of a cohort of the tenth legion. Among these 
prisoners you will particularly identify an

here and march them all to the Coliseum, where 
you will deliver them into the custody of the 
master of the gladiators and take his receipt, 
countersigned by the keeper of the beasts and 
the acting manager. You understand your 
instructions?

parade, and descends from his perch. The Cen¬ 
turion seats himself on it and prepares for a 
nap, whilst his men stand at ease. The Christians 
sit down on the west side of the square, glad to 
rest. Lavinia alone remains standing to speak to 
the Captain ]. 

lavinia. Captain: is this man who is to join us the 
famous Ferrovius, who has made such wonderful 
conversions in the northern cities? 

the captain. Yes. We are warned that he has the 
strength of an elephant and the temper of a mad 
bull. Also that he is stark mad. Not a model 
Christian, it would seem. 

lavinia. You need not fear him if he is a Christ¬ 
ian, Captain. 

the captain [coldly] I shall not fear him in any 
case, Lavinia.

Captain!

say. [In a lower tone, humane and urgent ] Lavinia: 
do Christians know how to love? 
lavinia [1 composedly ] Yes, Captain: they love even 
their enemies. 

the captain. Is that easy? 
lavinia. Very easy, Captain, when their enemies 
are as handsome as you. 

the captain. Lavinia: you are laughing at me. 
lavinia. At you, Captain! Impossible. 
the captain. Then you are flirting with me, 
which is worse. Dont be foolish. 

LAVINIA. But such a very handsome captain. 
the captain. Incorrigible! [ Urgently ] Listen to 
me. The men in that audience tomorrow will be 
the vilest of voluptuaries: men in whom the only 
passion excited by a beautiful woman is a lust to 
see her tortured and torn shrieking limb from 
limb. It is a crime to gratify that passion. It is 
offering yourself for violation by the whole rabble 
of the streets and the riff-raff of the court at the 
same time. Why will you not choose rather a 
kindly love and an honorable alliance? 
lavinia. They cannot violate my soul. I alone can 
do that by sacrificing to false gods. 
the captain. Sacrifice then to the true God. 
What does his name matter? We call him Jupiter. 
The Greeks call him Zeus. Call him what you 
will as you drop the incense on the altar flame; 
He will understand. 

LAVINIA. No. I couldnt. That is the strange thing, 
Captain, that a little pinch of incense should 
make all that difference. Religion is such a great

thing that when I meet really religious people we 
are friends at once, no matter what name we give 
to the divine will that made us and moves us. 
Oh, do you think that I, a woman, would quarrel 
with you for sacrificing to a woman god like 
Diana, if Diana meant to you what Christ means 
to me? No: we should kneel side by side before 
her altar like two children. But when men who 
believe neither in my god nor in their own - 
men who do not know the meaning of the word 
religion - when these men drag me to the foot of 
an iron statue that has become the symbol of the 
terror and darkness through which they walk, of 
their cruelty and greed, of their hatred of God 
and their oppression of man - when they ask me 
to pledge my soul before the people that this 
hideous idol is God, and that all this wickedness 
and falsehood is divine truth, I cannot do it, not 
if they could put a thousand cruel deaths on me. 
I tell you, it is physically impossible. Listen, 
Captain: did you ever try to catch a mouse in 
your hand? Once there was a dear little mouse 
that used to come out and play on my table as 
I was reading. I wanted to take him in my hand 
and caress him; and sometimes he got among 
my books so that he could not escape me when 
I stretched out my hand. And I did stretch out 
my hand; but it always came back in spite of me. 
I was not afraid of him in my heart; but my hand 
refused: it is not in the nature of my hand to 
touch a mouse. Well, Captain, if I took a pinch of 
incense in my hand and stretched it out over the

altar fire, my hand would come back. My body 
would be true to my faith even if you could 
corrupt my mind. And all the time I should 
believe more in Diana than my persecutors have 
ever believed in anything. Can you understand 
that? 

THE captain [ simply ] Yes; I understand that. But 
my hand would not come back. The hand that 
holds the sword has been trained not to come 
back from anything but victory. 

lavinia. Not even from death? 

THE captain. Least of all from death. 

lavinia. Then I must not come back from death 
either. A woman has to be braver than a soldier. 

THE CAPTAIN. Prouder, you mean. 

lavinia [startled] Prouder! You call our courage 
pride! 

the captain. There is no such thing as courage: 
there is only pride. You Christians are the 
proudest devils on earth. 

lavinia [hurt] Pray God then my pride may never 
become a false pride. [She turns away as if she did 
not wish to continue the conversation, but softetis 
and says to him with a smile] Thank you for trying 
to save me. 

the captain. I knew it was no use; but one tries 
in spite of one’s knowledge. 

lavinia. Something stirs, even in the iron breast 
of a Roman soldier? 

THE captain. I will soon be iron again. I have 
seen many women die, and forgotten them in a 
week.

lav in I A. Remember me for a fortnight, hand¬ 
some Captain. I shall be watching you, perhaps. 

the captain. From the skies? Do not deceive 
yourself, Lavinia. There is no future for you 
beyond the grave. 

lavinia. What does that matter? Do you think 
I am only running away from the terrors of life 
into the comfort of heaven? If there were no 
future, or if the future were one of torment, 
I should have to go just the same. The hand of 
God is upon me. 

the captain. Yes: when all is said, we are both 
patricians, Lavinia, and must die for our beliefs. 
Farewell. [He offers her his hand. She takes it and 
presses it. He walks away, trim and calm. She 
looks after him for a moment, and cries a little 
as he disappears through the eastern arch. A 
trumpet-call is heard from the road through the 
western arch]. 

centurion [waking up and rising] Cohort of the 
tenth with prisoners. Two file out with me to 
receive them. [He goes out through the western 
arch, followed by four soldiers in two files], 
Lentulus and Metellus come into the square 
from the west side with a little retinue of 
servants. Both are young courtiers, dressed in the 
extremity of fashion. Lentulus is slender, 
fair-haired, epicene. Metellus is manly, com¬ 
pactly built, olive skinned, not a talker. 

lentulus. Christians, by Jove! Lets chaff them.

lentulus [indicating Lavinia, who is still 
looking towards the arches after the Captain ] 
That woman’s got a figure. [He walks past her, 
staring at her invitingly; but she is preoccupied 
and is not conscious of him]. Do you turn the 
other cheek when they kiss you? 
lavinia [starting] What? 

lentulus. Do you turn the other cheek when 
they kiss you, fascinating Christian? 
lavinia. Dont be foolish. [To Metellus, who has 
remained on her right, so that she is between them] 
Please dont let your friend behave like a cad 
before the soldiers. How are they to respect and 
obey patricians if they see them behaving like 
street boys? [Sharply to Lentulus] Pull yourself 
together, man. Hold your head up. Keep the 
corners of your mouth firm; and treat me respect¬ 
fully. What do you take me for?

turns decisively away and sits down with her 
comrades, leaving him disconcerted].

you they were brutes.

I care. [With an air of indifference he strolls with

stand watching the return of the Centurion through

prisoners: Ferrovius, Androcles, and Spintho. 
Ferrovius is a powerful, choleric man in 
the prime of life, with large nostrils, staring eyes, 
and a thick neck: a man whose sensibilities are keen 
and violent to the verge of madness. Spintho is 
a debauchee, the wreck of a good-looking man gone 
hopelessly to the bad. Androcles is overwhelmed 
with grief, and is restraining his tears with great 
difficulty], 

centurion [to Lavinia] Here are some pals for 
you. This little bit is Ferrovius that you talk so 
much about. [.Ferrovius turns on him threateningly. 
The Centurion holds up his left forefinger in 
admonition]. Now remember that youre a Christ¬ 
ian, and that youve got to return good for evil. 
[Ferrovius controls himself convulsively; 

moves away from temptation to the east side near 
Lentulus; clasps his hands in silent prayer; 
and throws himself on his knees]. Thats the way 
to manage them, eh! This fine fellow [indicating 
Androcles, who comes to his left, and makes 
Lavinia a heart-broken salutation] is a sor¬ 
cerer. A Greek tailor, he is. A real sorcerer, 
too: no mistake about it. The tenth marches with a 
leopard at the head of the column. He made a pet 
of the leopard; and now he’s crying at being parted 
from it. [Androcles sniffs lamentably], 

Aint you, old chap? Well, cheer up, we march with 
a Billy goat [Androcles brightens up] thats 
killed two leopards and ate a turkey-cock. You can 
have him for a pet if you like. [Androcles, quite 
consoled, goes past the Centurion to Lavinia,

Christian. He mobs the temples, he does [at each 
accusation he gives the neck of Spintho’s tunic a 
tzvist]; he goes smashing things mad drunk, he 
does; he steals the gold vessels, he does; he assaults 
the priestesses, he does - yah! [He flings Spintho

Beat me. Revile me. Our Lord was beaten and

Yes, by the grace of God, I do, now.

Ferrovins intently. Ferrovius, without flinching, 
turns the other cheek. Lentulus, rather out of 
countenance, titters foolishly, and strikes him again 
feebly ]. You know, I should feel ashamed if I let 
myself be struck like that, and took it lying down. 
But then I’m not a Christian: I’m a man. 
[Ferrovius rises impressively and towers over 
him. Lentulus becomes white with terror; and 
a shade of green flickers in his cheek for a 
moment]. 

ferrovius [with the calm of a steam hammer] I 
have not always been faithful. The first man 
who struck me as you have just struck me was a 
stronger man than you: he hit me harder than 
I expected. I was tempted and fell; and it was 
then that I first tasted bitter shame. I never had 
a happy moment after that until I had knelt and 
asked his forgiveness by his bedside in the 
hospital. [Putting his hands on Lentulus's 
shoulders with paternal weight]. But now I have 
learnt to resist with a strength that is not my own. 
I am not ashamed now, nor angry. 

lentulus [uneasily] Er-good evening. [He tries 
to move away], 

ferrovius [gripping his shoulders] Oh, do not 
harden your heart, young man. Come: try for 
yourself whether our way is not better than 
yours. I will now strike you on one cheek; and 
you will turn the other and learn how much 
better you will feel than if you gave way to the

lentulus. Centurion: I call on you to protect 
me. 

centurion. You asked for it, sir. It’s no business 
of ours. Youve had two whacks at him. Better 
pay him a trifle and square it that way. 

lentulus. Yes, of course. [To Ferrovius] It was 
only a bit of fun, I assure you: I meant no 
harm. Here. [He proffers a gold coin]. 

ferrovius [taking it and throwing it to the old 
beggar, who snatches it up eagerly, and hobbles off 
to spend it] Give all thou hast to the poor. Come, 
friend: courage! I may hurt your body for a 
moment; but your soul will rejoice in the victory 
of the spirit over the flesh. [He prepares to 
strike], 

androcles. Easy, Ferrovius, easy: you broke the 
last man’s jaw. 

Lentulus, with a moan of terror, attempts to 
fly; but Ferrovius holds him ruthlessly. 

ferrovius. Yes; but I saved his soul. What 
matters a broken jaw? 

lentulus. Dont touch me, do you hear? The 
law - 

ferrovius. The law will throw me to the lions 
tomorrow; what worse could it do were I to 
slay you? Pray for strength; and it shall be given 
to you. 

lentulus. Let me go. Your religion forbids you 
to strike me. 

ferrovius. On the contrary, it commands me to

strike you. How can you turn the other cheek, if 
you are not first struck on the one cheek? 

lentulus [almost in tears ] But I’m convinced 
already that what you said is quite right. I apolo¬ 
gize for striking you. 

ferrovius [greatly pleased ] My son: have I 
softened your heart? Has the good seed fallen 
in a fruitful place? Are your feet turning 
towards a better path? 

lentulus [abjectly] Yes, yes. Theres a great 
deal in what you say. 

FERROVIUS [radiant] Join us. Come to the lions. 
Come to suffering and death. 

lentulus [falling on his knees and bursting into 
tears] Oh, help me. Mother! mother! 

ferrovius. These tears will water your soul and 
make it bring forth good fruit, my son. God has 
greatly blessed my efforts at conversion. Shall 
I tell you a miracle - yes, a miracle - wrought by 
me in Cappadocia? A young man - just such a 
one as you, with golden hair like yours - scoffed 
at and struck me as you scoffed at and struck me. 

I sat up all night with that youth wrestling for 
his soul; and in the morning not only was he a 
Christian, but his hair was as white as snow. 
[Lentulus falls in a dead faint]. There, there: take 
him away. The spirit has overwrought him, poor 
lad. Carry him gently to his house; and leave the 
rest to heaven. 

centurion. Take him home. [The servants, 
intimidated, hastily carry him out. Metellus is

about to follow when Ferrovius lays his hand on 
his shoulder ]. 

ferrovius. You are his friend, young man. You 
will see that he is taken safely home. 
metellus [with awestruck civility ] Certainly, sir. 
I shall do whatever you think best. Most happy 
to have made your acquaintance, I’m sure. You 
may depend on me. Good evening, sir. 
ferrovius [with unction ] The blessing of heaven 
upon you and him. 

Metellus follows Lentulus. The Centur¬ 
ion returns to his seat to resume his interrupted 
nap. The deepest awe has settled on the spec¬ 
tators. Ferrovius, with a long sigh of happiness , 
goes to Lavinia, and offers her his hand. 
lavinia [taking it] So that is how you convert 
people, Ferrovius. 

ferrovius. Yes: there has been a blessing on 
my work in spite of my unworthiness and my 
backslidings - all through my wicked, devilish 
temper. This man - 

androcles [hastily] Dont slap me on the back, 
brother. She knows you mean me. 
ferrovius. How I wish I were weak like our 
brother here! for then I should perhaps be meek 
and gentle like him. And yet there seems to be a 
special providence that makes my trials less than 
his. I hear tales of the crowd scoffing and casting 
stones and reviling the brethren; but when I come, 
all this stops: my influence calms the passions of 
the mob: they listen to me in silence; and infidels 
are often converted by a straight heart-to-heart

talk with me. Every day I feel happier, more con¬ 
fident. Every day lightens the load of the great 
terror. 

lavinia. The great terror? What is that? 

Ferrovius shakes his head and does not answer. 
He sits down beside her on her left, and buries 
his face in his hands in gloomy meditation. 

androcles. Well, you see, sister, he’s never quite 
sure of himself. Suppose at the last moment in 
the arena, with the gladiators there to fight him, 
one of them was to say anything to annoy him, 
he might forget himself and lay that gladiator out. 

lavinia. That would be splendid. 

ferrovius [ springing up in horror ] What! 

androcles. Oh, sister! 

ferrovius. Splendid to betray my master, like 
Peter! Splendid to act like any common 
blackguard in the day of my proving! Woman: 
you are no Christian. [He moves away from her to 
the middle of the square, as if her neighborhood 
contaminated him], 

lavinia [laughing] You know, Ferrovius, I am not 
always a Christian. I dont think anybody is. 
There are moments when I forget all about it, 
and something comes out quite naturally, as it 
did then. 

spintho. What does it matter? If you die in the 
arena, youll be a martyr; and all martyrs go to 
heaven, no matter what they have done. Thats 
so, isnt it, Ferrovius? 

ferrovius. Yes: that is so, if we are faithful to the 
end.

LAVINIA. I’m not so sure. 

spintho. Dont say that. Thats blasphemy. Dont 
say that, I tell you. We shall be saved, no matter 
what we do. 

LAVINIA. Perhaps you men will all go into heaven 
bravely and in triumph, with your heads erect 
and golden trumpets sounding for you. But I am 
sure, I shall only be allowed to squeeze myself 
in through a little crack in the gate after a great 
deal of begging. I am not good always: I have 
moments only. 

spintho. Youre talking nonsense, woman. I tell 
you, martyrdom pays all scores. 

androcles. Well, let us hope so, brother, for 
your sake. Youve had a gay time, havnt you? with 
your raids on the temples. I cant help thinking 
that heaven will be very dull for a man of your 
temperament. [ Spintho snarls ]. Dont be angry: 
I say it only to console you in case you should die 
in your bed tonight in the natural way. There’s 
a lot of plague about. 

spintho [rising and running about in abject terror\ 
I never thought of that. Oh Lord, spare me to be 
martyred. Oh, what a thought to put into the 
mind of a brother! Oh, let me be martyred today, 
now. I shall die in the night and go to hell. Youre 
a sorcerer: youve put death into my mind. Oh, 
curse you, curse you! [He tries to seize Androcles 
by the throat ]. 

ferrovius [holding him in a grasp of iron] Whats 
this, brother? Anger! Violence! Raising your 
hand to a brother Christian!

spintho. It’s easy for you. Youre strong. Your 
nerves are all right. But I’m full of disease. 
[Ferrovius takes his hand from him with 
instinctive disgust] . Ive drunk all my nerves 
away. I shall have the horrors all night. 
androcles [ sympathetically ] Oh, dont take on so, 
brother. We’re all sinners. 
spintho [ snivelling , trying to feel consoled] Yes: 
I daresay if the truth were known, youre all as 
bad as I am. 

lavinia \contemptuously] Does that comfort you? 
ferrovius [ sternly ] Pray, man, pray. 
spintho. Whats the good of praying? If we’re 
martyred we shall go to heaven, shant we, 
whether we pray or not? 

ferrovius. Whats that? Not pray! [ Seizing him 
again] Pray this instant, you dog, you rotten 
hound, you slimy snake, you beastly goat, or - 
spintho. Yes: beat me: kick me. I forgive you: 
mind that. 

ferrovius [ spurning him with loathing ] Yah! 
[,Spintho reels away and falls in front of 
Ferrovius], 

androcles [reaching out and catching the skirt of 
Ferrovius's tunic ] Dear brother: if you wouldnt 
mind - just for my sake - 
ferrovius. Well? 

androcles. Dont call him by the names of the 
animals. Weve no right to. Ive had such friends 
in dogs. A pet snake is the best of company. I was 
nursed on goat’s milk. Is it fair to them to call 
the like of him a dog or a snake or a goat?

androcles [anxiously protesting] Oh, believe me, 
they have. Just the same as you and me. I really 
dont think I could consent to go to heaven if 
I thought there were to be no animals there. 
Think of what they suffer here. 
ferrovius. Thats true. Yes: that is just. They 
will have their share in heaven.

you say? 

spintho [cowering] Nothing. 
ferrovius [ clenching his fist ] Do animals go to 
heaven or not? 

spintho. I never said they didnt. 

FERROVIUS [implacable] Do they or do they not? 
spintho. They do: they do. [ Scrambling out of 
Ferrovius's reach]. Oh, curse you for frightening 
me!

the lion’s dinner is menagerie service too. This

So back with you to your bullocks double quick; 
and learn your place. March. [ The soldiers start]. 
Now then, you Christians: step out there.

ACT II 


Behind the Emperor's box at the Coliseum, where the 
performers assemble before entering the arena. In the 
middle a wide passage leading to the arena descends 
from the floor level under the imperial box. On both 
sides of this passage steps ascend to a landing at the 
back entrance to the box. The landing forms a bridge 
across the passage. At the entrance to the passage are 
two bronze mirrors, one on each side. 

On the west side of this passage, on the right hand 
of anyone coming from the box and standing on the 
bridge, the martyrs are sitting on the steps. Lavinia 
is seated half-way up, thoughtfid, trying to look 
death in the face. On her left Androcles consoles 
himself by nursing a cat. Ferrovius stands behind 
them, his eyes blazing, his figure stiff with intense 
resolution. At the foot of the steps crouches Spintho, 
with his head clutched in his hands, full of horror at 
the approach of martyrdom. 

On the east side of the passage the gladiators are 
standing and sitting at ease, waiting, like the Christ¬ 
ians, for their turn in the arena. One ( Retiarius ) 
is a nearly naked man with a net and a trident. 
Another (Secular) is in armor with a sword. He 
carries a helmet with a barred visor. The editor of the 
gladiators sits on a chair a little apart from them. 
The Call Boy enters from the passage. 

the call boy. Number six. Retiarius versus 
Secutor. 

The gladiator with the net picks it up. The

gladiator with the helmet puts it on; and the two 
go into the arena, the net throzver taking out a little 
brush and arranging his hair as he goes, the other 
tightening his straps and shaking his shoulders 
loose. Both look at themselves in the mirrors before 
they enter the passage. 

LA V1NI A. Will they really kill one another? 

spintho. Yes, if the people turn down their 
thumbs. 

the editor. You know nothing about it. The 
people indeed! Do you suppose we would kill 
a man worth perhaps fifty talents to please the 
riffraff? I should like to catch any of my men 
at it. 

SPINTHO. I thought - 

the editor [ contemptuously ] You thought! Who 
cares what you think? You 11 be killed all right 
enough. 

spintho [groans and again hides his face ]!!! 

lavinia. Then is nobody ever killed except us 
poor Christians? 

the editor. If the vestal virgins turn down their 
thumbs, thats another matter. Theyre ladies of 
rank. 

lavinia. Does the Emperor ever interfere? 

the editor. Oh, yes: he turns his thumb up fast 
enough if the vestal virgins want to have one of 
his pet fighting men killed. 

androcles. But dont they ever just only pre¬ 
tend to kill one another? Why shouldnt you pre¬ 
tend to die, and get dragged out as if you were

dead; and then get up and go home, like an 
actor? 

the editor. See here: you want to know too 
much. There will be no pretending about the 
new lion: let that be enough for you. He’s 
hungry. 

spintho [groaning with horror] Oh, Lord! cant you 
stop talking about it? Isnt it bad enough for us 
without that? 

androcles. I’m glad he’s hungry. Not that I 
want him to suffer, poor chap! but then he’ll 
enjoy eating me so much more. Theres a cheer¬ 
ful side to everything. 

the editor [rising and striding over to Androcles] 
Here: dont you be obstinate. Come with me and 
drop the pinch of incense on the altar. Thats all 
you need do to be let off. 

androcles. No: thank you very much indeed; 
but I really mustnt. 

the editor. What! Not to save your life? 

androcles. I’d rather not. I couldnt sacrifice to 
Diana: she’s a huntress, you know, and kills 
things. 

the editor. That dont matter. You can choose 
your own altar. Sacrifice to Jupiter: he likes 
animals: he turns himself into an animal when 
he goes off duty. 

androcles. No: it’s very kind of you; but I feel 
I cant save myself that way. 

the editor. But I dont ask you to do it to save 
yourself: I ask you to do it to oblige me 
personally.

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

androcles [scrambling up in the greatest agita¬ 
tion] Oh, please dont say that. This is dreadful. 
You mean so kindly by me that it seems quite 
horrible to disoblige you. If you could arrange for 
me to sacrifice when theres nobody looking, I 
shouldnt mind. But I must go into the arena with 
the rest. My honor, you know. 
the editor. Honor! The honor of a tailor? 
androcles [apologetically] Well, perhaps honor 
is too strong an expression. Still, you know, 
I couldnt allow the tailors to get a bad name 
through me. 

the editor. How much will you remember of all 
that when you smell the beast’s breath and see 
his jaws opening to tear out your throat? 
spintho [rising with a yell of terror] I cant bear it. 

Wheres the altar? I’ll sacrifice. 
ferrovius. Dog of an apostate. Iscariot! 
spintho. I’ll repent afterwards. I fully mean to 
die in the arena: I’ll die a martyr and go to 
heaven; but not this time, not now, not until my 
nerves are better. Besides, I’m too young: I want 
to have just one more good time. [The gladiators 
laugh at him]. Oh, will no one tell me where the 
altar is? [lie dashes into the passage and vanishes]. 
androcles [to the Editor, pointing after Spintho] 
Brother: I cant do that, not even to oblige you. 
Dont ask me. 

the editor. Well, if youre determined to die, I 
cant help you. But I wouldnt be put off by a 
swine like that.

thee behind him, Satan. 

the editor [ flushing with rage ] For two pins I’d 
take a turn in the arena myself today, and pay 
you out for daring to talk to me like that. 
Ferrovius springs forward. 
lavinia [rising quickly and interposing] Brother, 
brother: you forget. 

ferrovius [ curbing himself by a mighty effort] Oh, 
my temper, my wicked temper! [To the Editor, 
as Lavinia sits dozen again, reassured] Forgive 
me, brother. My heart was full of wrath: I should

say to the Emperor when he sees one of my lions 
coming into the arena half asleep? 
the editor. Say nothing. Give your old lion 
some bitters and a morsel of fried fish to wake 
up his appetite. [. Laughter ]. 
the keeper. Yes: it’s easy for you to talk; but- 
the editor [scrambling to his feet] Sh! Attention 
there! The Emperor. [The Keeper bolts precipi¬ 
tately into the passage. The gladiators rise smartly 
and form into line]. 

The Emperor enters on the Christians' side, 
conversing with Metellus, and followed by his 
suite. 

the gladiators. Hail, Caesar! those about to die 
salute thee. 

caesar. Good morrow, friends. 

Metellus shakes hands with the Editor, who 
accepts his condescension with bluff respect. 
lavinia. Blessing, Caesar, and forgiveness! 
caesar [turning in some surprise at the salutation] 
There is no forgiveness for Christianity. 
lavinia. I did not mean that, Caesar. I mean that 
we forgive you. 

metellus. An inconceivable liberty! Do you not 
know, woman, that the Emperor can do no 
wrong and therefore cannot be forgiven? 
lavinia. I expect the Emperor knows better. 

Anyhow, we forgive him. 

THE Christians. Amen! 

caesar. Metellus: you see now the disadvantage of 
too much severity. These people have no hope; 
therefore they have nothing to restrain them

almost as impertinent as the gladiators. Which 
is the Greek sorcerer? 

androcles [ humbly touching his forelock ] Me, 
your Worship. 

caesar. My Worship! Good! A new title. Well: 
what miracles can you perform? 

androcles. I can cure warts by rubbing them 
with my tailor’s chalk; and I can live with my 
wife without beating her. 

caesar. Is that all? 

androcles. You dont know her, Caesar, or you 
wouldnt say that. 

CAESAR. Ah, well, my friend, we shall no doubt 
contrive a happy release for you. Which is 
Ferrovius? 

ferrovius. I am he. 

caesar. They tell me you can fight. 

ferrovius. It is easy to fight, I can die, Caesar. 

caesar. That is still easier, is it not? 

ferrovius. Not to me, Caesar. Death comes hard 
to my flesh; and fighting comes very easily to my 
spirit [beating his breast and lamenting ] Oh, 
sinner that I am! [He throws himself dozen on the 
steps, deeply discouraged ]. 

caesar. Metellus: I should like to have this man in 
the Pretorian Guard. 

metellus. / should not, Caesar. He looks a spoil¬ 
sport. There are men in whose presence it is 
impossible to have any fun: men who are a sort 
of walking conscience. He would make us all 
uncomfortable.

caesar. For that reason, perhaps, it might be as 
well to have him. An Emperor can hardly have 
too many consciences. [To Ferrovius] Listen, 
Ferrovius. [ Ferrovius shakes his head and will not 
look up]. You and your friends shall not be out¬ 
numbered today in the arena. You shall have 
arms; and there will be no more than one 
gladiator to each Christian. If you come out of 
the arena alive, I will consider favorably any 
request of yours, and give you a place in the 
Pretorian Guard. Even if the request be that no 
questions be asked about your faith I shall 
perhaps not refuse it. 

ferrovius. I will not fight. I will die. Better stand 
with the archangels than with the Pretorian 
Guard. 

caesar. I cannot believe that the archangels - 
whoever they may be - would not prefer to be 
recruited from the Pretorian Guard. However, 
as you please. Come: let us see the show. 

As the Court ascends the steps, Secutor and 
Retiarius return from the arena through the 
passage: Secutor covered with dust and very 
angry: Retiarius grinning. 

secutor. Ha, the Emperor. Now we shall see. 
Caesar: I ask you whether it is fair for the 
Retiarius, instead of making a fair throw of his 
net at me, to swish it along the ground and throw 
the dust in my eyes, and then catch me when 
I’m blinded. If the vestals had not turned up 
their thumbs I should have been a dead man.

caesar [ halting on the stair] There is nothing in 
the rules against it. 

secutor [ indignantly ] Caesar: is it a dirty trick 
or is it not? 

CAESAR. It is a dusty one, my friend. [Obsequious 
laughter ]. Be on your guard next time. 
secutor. Let him be on his guard. Next time I’ll 
throw my sword at his heels and strangle him 
with his own net before he can hop off. [To the 
Retiarius ] You see if I dont. [He goes out past the 
gladiators, sulky and furious], 
caesar [/o the chuckling Retiarius ] These tricks are 
not wise, my friend. The audience likes to see a 
dead man in all his beauty and splendor. If you 
smudge his face and spoil his armor they will 
shew their displeasure by not letting you kill 
him. And when your turn comes, they will 
remember it against you and turn their thumbs 
down. 

retiarius. Perhaps that is why I did it, 
Caesar. He bet me ten sesterces that he would 
vanquish me. If I had had to kill him I should 
not have had the money. 

caesar [indulgent, laughing] You rogues: there is 
no end to your tricks. I’ll dismiss you all and 
have elephants to fight. They fight fairly. [He 
goes up to his box, and knocks at it. It is opened 
from -within by the Captain, who stands as on 
parade to let him pass]. 

The Call Boy comes from the passage, followed 
by three attendants carrying respectively a bundle 
of swords, some helmets, and some breastplates

eleven! Gladiators and Christians! 

Ferrovius springs up, ready for martyrdom. 
The other Christians take the summons as best they 
can, some joyfid and brave, some patient and 
dignified, some tearful and helpless, some em¬ 
bracing one another with emotion. The Call Boy

has come, Ferrovius. I shall go into my box and 
see you killed, since you scorn the Pretorian

Metellus and the rest of the suite disperse to their 
seats. The Christians, led by Ferrovius, move 
towards the passage].

the editor. Steady there. You Christians have 
got to fight. Here! arm yourselves.

my Master’s will, and that I could kill the man 
who kills me if I chose.

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

accused of sending a naked man in to fight my 
men in armor? 

FERROVIUS. Say your prayers, brother; and have 
no fear of the princes of this world. 

the editor. Tsha! You obstinate fool! [He bites 
his lips irresolutely, not knowing exactly what to 
do], 

androcles [to Ferrovius ] Farewell, brother, till 
we meet in the sweet by-and-by. 

theeditor [to Androcles ] You are going too. 
Take a sword there; and put on any armor you 
can find to fit you. 

androcles. No, really: I cant fight: I never 
could: I cant bring myself to dislike anyone 
enough. I’m to be thrown to the lions with the 
lady. 

the editor. Then get out of the way and hold 
your noise. [Androcles steps aside with cheerful 
docility ]. Now then! Are you all ready there? 

A trumpet is heard from the arena. 

ferrovius [starting convulsively ] Heaven give me 
strength! 

the editor. Aha! That frightens you, does it? 

ferrovius. Man: there is no terror like the terror 
of that sound to me. When I hear a trumpet or 
a drum or the clash of steel or the hum of the 
catapult as the great stone flies, fire runs through 
my veins: I feel my blood surge up hot behind 
my eyes: I must charge: I must strike: I must 
conquer: Caesar himself will not be safe in his 
imperial seat if once that spirit gets loose in me. 
Oh, brothers, pray! exhort me! remind me that

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

if I raise my sword my honor falls and my Master 
is crucified afresh. 

androcles. Just keep thinking how cruelly you 
might hurt the poor gladiators. 
ferrovius. It does not hurt a man to kill him. 
lavinia. Nothing but faith can save you. 
ferrovius. Faith! Which faith? There are two 
faiths. There is our faith. And there is the 
warrior’s faith, the faith in fighting, the faith 
that sees God in the sword. IIow if that faith 
should overwhelm me? 

lavinia. You will find your real faith in the hour 
of trial. 

ferrovius. That is what I fear. I know that I am 
a fighter. How can I feel sure that I am a 
Christian? 

androcles. Throw away the sword, brother. 
ferrovius. I cannot. It cleaves to my hand. 
I could as easily throw a woman I loved from 
my arms. [Starting] Who spoke that blasphemy? 
Not I. 

lavinia. I cant help you, friend. I cant tell you 
not to save your own life. Something wilful in 
me wants to see you fight your way into heaven. 
ferrovius. Ha! 

androcles. But if you are going to give up our 
faith, brother, why not do it without hurting 
anybody? Dont fight them. Burn the incense. 
ferrovius. Burn the incense! Never. 

LAVINIA. That is only pride, Ferrovius. 
ferrovius. Only pride! What is nobler than

lavinia. They say we Christians are the proudest 
devils on earth - that only the weak are meek. 
Oh, I am worse than you. I ought to send you to 
death; and I am tempting you. 

ANDROCLES. Brother, brother: let them rage and

lamb to the slaughter.

is slain by the butcher; but as a butcher might 
let himself be slain by a [looking at the Editor]

from the Emperor’s box and descends the steps.

stage is waiting.

ators told off to fight with the Christians march 
down the passage\ Follow up there, you.

faith, brother. Farewell. Go to glory, dearest. 
Farewell. Remember: we are praying for you.

Farewell. Be strong, brother. Farewell. Dont

remember that, brother. Farewell. Eternal 
glory, dearest. Farewell. 

the editor [out of patience] Shove them in, there. 

The remaining gladiators and the Call Boy make 
a movement towards them. 

ferrovius [interposing] Touch them, dogs; and we 
die here, and cheat the heathen of their spec¬ 
tacle. [To his fellow Christians] Brothers: 
the great moment has come. That passage is your 
hill to Calvary. Mount it bravely, but meekly; 
and remember! not a word of reproach, not a 
blow nor a struggle. Go. [They go out through 
the passage. He turns to Lavinia] Farewell. 

lavinia. You forget: I must follow before you are 
cold. 

ferrovius. It is true. Do not envy me because I 
pass before you to glory. [He goes through the 
passage], 

the editor [to the Call Boy] Sickening work, this. 
Why cant they all be thrown to the lions? It’s 
not a man’s job. [He throws himself moodily 
into his chair]. 

The remaining gladiators go back to their former 
places indifferently. The Call Boy shrugs his 
shoidders and squats down at the entrance to the 
passage, near the Editor. 

Lavinia and the Christian women sit down 
again, wrung zvith grief, some weeping silently, 
some praying, some calm and steadfast. Androcles

sits down at Lavinia’s feet. The Captain stands 
on the stairs, watching her curiously. 
androcles. I’m glad I havnt to fight. That xvould 
really be an awful martyrdom. Iam lucky. 
lavinia [looking at him with a pang of remorse\ 
Androcles: burn the incense: youll be forgiven. 
Let my death atone for both. I feel as if I were 
killing you. 

androcles. Dont think of me, sister. Think of 
yourself. That will keep your heart up.

presence ] Are you there, handsome Captain? 
Have you come to see me die? 
the captain [coming to her side] I am on duty 
with the Emperor, Lavinia. 
lavinia. Is it part of your duty to laugh at us? 
the captain. No: that is part of my private 
pleasure. Your friend here is a humorist. I 
laughed at his telling you to think of yourself to 
keep up your heart. / say, think of yourself and 
burn the incense. 

lavinia. He is not a humorist: he was right. You 
ought to know that, Captain: you have been face 
to face with death. 

the captain. Not with certain death, Lavinia. 
Only death in battle, which spares more men 
than death in bed. What you are facing is certain 
death. You have nothing left now but your faith 
in this craze of yours: this Christianity. Are your 
Christian fairy stories any truer than our stories 
about Jupiter and Diana, in which, I may tell

you, I believe no more than the Emperor does, 
or any educated man in Rome? 

lavinia. Captain: all that seems nothing to me 
now. I’ll not say that death is a terrible thing; 
but I will say that it is so real a thing that when 
it comes close, all the imaginary things - all the 
stories, as you call them - fade into mere dreams 
beside that inexorable reality. I know now that 
I am not dying for stories or dreams. Did you 
hear of the dreadful thing that happened here 
while we were waiting? 

the captain. I heard that one of your fellows 
bolted, and ran right into the jaws of the lion. 
I laughed. I still laugh. 

lavinia. Then you dont understand what that 
meant? 

the captain. It meant that the lion had a cur for 
his breakfast. 

lavinia. It meant more than that, Captain. It 
meant that a man cannot die for a story and a 
dream. None of us believed the stories and the 
dreams more devoutly than poor Spintho; but 
he could not face the great reality. What he 
would have called my faith has been oozing 
away minute by minute whilst Ive been sitting 
here, with death coming nearer and nearer, with 
reality becoming realler and reader, with stories 
and dreams fading away into nothing. 

THE captain. Are you then going to die for 
nothing? 

lavinia. Yes: that is the wonderful thing. It is 
since all the stories and dreams have gone that

I have now no doubt at all that I must die for 
something greater than dreams or stories. 

THE CAPTAIN. But for what? 
lavinia. I dont know. If it were for anything 
small enough to know, it would be too small to 
die for. I think I’m going to die for God. 
Nothing else is real enough to die for. 
the captain. What is God? 
lavinia. When we know that, Captain, we shall 
be gods ourselves. 

the captain. Lavinia: come down to earth. Burn 
the incense and marry me. 
lavinia. Handsome Captain; would you marry 
me if I hauled down the flag in the day of battle 
and burnt the incense? Sons take after their 
mothers, you know. Do you want your son to be 
a coward? 

the captain [strongly moved ] By great Diana, I 
think I would strangle you if you gave in now. 
lavinia [putting her hand on the head of Andrades'] 
The hand of God is on us three, Captain. 
the captain. What nonsense it all is! And what a 
monstrous thing that you should die for such 
nonsense, and that I should look on helplessly 
when my whole soul cries out against it! Die 
then if you must; but at least I can cut the 
Emperor’s throat and then my own when I see 
your blood. 

The Emperor throws open the door of his box 
angrily, and appears in wrath on the threshold. 
The Editor, the Call Boy, and the gladiators 
spring to their feet.

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

THE emperor. The Christians will not fight; and 
your curs cannot get their blood up to attack 
them. It’s all that fellow with the blazing eyes. 
Send for the whip. [The Call Boy rushes out on 
the east side for the whip]. If that will not move 
them, bring the hot irons. The man is like a 
mountain. [He returns angrily into the box and 
slams the door]. 

The Call Boy returns with a man in a hideous 
Etruscan mask, carrying a whip. They both rush 
down the passage into the arena. 
lavinia [rising] Oh, that is unworthy. Can they 
not kill him without dishonoring him? 
androcles [scrambling to his feet and running into 
the middle of the space between the staircase] It’s 
dreadful. Now I want to fight. I cant bear the 
sight of a whip. The only time I ever hit a man 
was when he lashed an old horse with a whip. 
It was terrible: I danced on his face when he was 
on the ground. He mustnt strike Ferrovius: I’ll 
go into the arena and kill him first. [He makes a 
wild dash into the passage. As he does so a great 
clamor is heard from the arena, ending in wild 
applause. The gladiators listen and look inquir¬ 
ingly at one another]. 
the editor. Whats up now? 
lavinia [7o the Captain] What has happened, do 
you think? 

the captain. What can happen? They are killing 
them, I suppose. 

androcles [running in through the passage, 
screaming with horror and hiding his eyes]!!!

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

i.avinia. Androcles, Androcles: whats the matter? 

androcles. Oh dont ask me, dont ask me. Some¬ 
thing too dreadful. Oh! [He crouches by her and 
hides his face in her robe, sobbing ]. 

THE call BOY [rushing through from the passage as 
before] Ropes and hooks there! Ropes and hooks! 

THE editor. Well, need you excite yourself about 
it? [Another burst of applause ]. 

Two slaves in Etruscan masks, with ropes and 
drag hooks, hurry in. 

one OF THE slaves. How many dead? 

the call boy. Six. [The slave blows a whistle 
twice; and four more masked slaves rush through 
into the arena with the same apparatus ] And the 
basket. Bring the baskets [ The slave whistles 
three times, and runs through the passage with his 
companion ]. 

the captain. Who are the baskets for? 

THE call boy. For the whip. He’s in pieces. 
Theyre all in pieces, more or less. [Lavinia 
hides her face]. 

Two more masked slaves come in with a basket 
and follow the others into the arena, as the Call 
Boy turns to the gladiators and exclaims, 
exhausted] Boys: he’s killed the lot. 

THE emperor [again bursting from his box, this 
time in an ecstasy of delight] Where is he? 
Magnificent! He shall have a laurel crown. 

Ferrovius, madly waving his bloodstained 
sword, rushes through the passage in despair, 
followed by his co-religionists, and by the Menagerie

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

Keeper , who goes to the gladiators. The gladiators 
draw their swords nervously. 
ferrovius. Lost! lost for ever! I have betrayed 
my Master. Cut off this right hand: it has 
offended. Ye have swords, my brethren: strike. 
1. a v 1 n 1 A. No, no. What have you done, Ferrovius? 
FERRO VIus. I know not; but there was blood 
behind my eyes; and theres blood on my sword. 
What does that mean? 

the emperor [ enthusiastically , on the landing out¬ 
side his box] What does it mean? It means that 
you are the greatest man in Rome. It means that 
you shall have a laurel crown of gold. Superb 
fighter: I could almost yield you my throne. It 
is a record for my reign: I shall live in history. 
Once, in Domitian’s time, a Gaul slew three 
men in the arena and gained his freedom. But 
when before has one naked man slain six armed 
men of the bravest and best? The persecution 
shall cease: if Christians can fight like this, I 
shall have none but Christians to fight for me. 
[7’o the Gladiators] You are ordered to become 
Christians, you there: do you hear? 
retiarius. It is all one to us, Caesar. Had I been 
there with my net, the story would have been 
different. 

the captain [suddenly seizing Lavinia by the 
zvrist and dragging her up the steps to the Emperor] 
Caesar: this woman is the sister of Ferrovius. If 
she is thrown to the lions he will fret. He will 
lose weight; get out of condition - 
the emperor. The lions? Nonsense! [To Lavinia]

Madam: I am proud to have the honor of making 
your acquaintance. Your brother is the glory of 
Rome. 

I.AVINIA. But my friends here. Must they die? 

THE emperor. Die! Certainly not. There has 
never been the slightest idea of harming them. 
Ladies and gentlemen: you are all free. Pray go 
into the front of the house and enjoy the 
spectacle to which your brother has so splen¬ 
didly contributed. Captain: oblige me by con¬ 
ducting them to the seats reserved for my 
personal friends. 

the menagerie keeper. Caesar: I must have 
one Christian for the lion. The people have been 
promised it; and they will tear the decorations to 
hits if they are disappointed. 

the emperor. True, true: we must have some¬ 
body for the new lion. 

eerrovius. Throw me to him. Let the apostate 
perish. 

the emperor. No, no: you would tear him in 
pieces, my friend; and we cannot afford to throw 
away lions as if they were mere slaves. But we 
must have somebody. This is really extremely 
awkward. 

the menagerie keeper. Why not that little 
Greek chap? He’s not a Christian: he’s a 
sorcerer. 

the emperor. The very thing: he will do very 
well. 

the call boy [issuing from the passage] Number 
twelve. The Christian for the new lion.

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

androcles [mm«, and pulling himself sadly 
together ] Well, it was to be, after all. 

I.AVINIA. I’ll go in his place, Caesar. Ask the 
Captain whether they do not like best to see a 
woman torn to pieces. He told me so yesterday. 

THE emperor. There is something in that: there 
is certainly something in that - if only I could 
feel sure that your brother would not fret. 

androcles. No: I should never have another 
happy hour. No: on the faith of a Christian and 
the honor of a tailor, I accept the lot that has 
fallen on me. If my wife turns up, give her my 
love and say that my wish was that she should be 
happy with her next, poor fellow! Caesar: go to 
your box and see how a tailor can die. Make way 
for number twelve there. [He marches out along 
the passage ]. 

The vast audience in the amphitheatre nozv sees 
the Emperor re-enter his box and take his place 
as Androcles, desperately frightened, but still 
marching with piteous devotion, emerges from the 
other end of the passage, and finds himself at the 
focus of thousands of eager eyes. The lion's cage, 
with a heavy portcullis grating, is on his left. 
The Emperor gives a signal. A gong sounds. And¬ 
rocles shivers at the sound; then falls on his 
knees and prays. The grating rises with a clash. 
The lion bounds into the arena. He rushes round 
frisking in his freedom. He sees Androcles. He 
stops; rises stiffly by straightening his legs; 
stretches out his nose forward and his tail in a 
horizontal line behind, like a pointer, and utters

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

i/m appalling roar. Androcles crouches and hides his 
face in his hands. The lion gathers himself 
for a spring, swishing his tail to and fro through the 
dust in an ecstasy of anticipation. Androcles 
throws up his hands in supplication to heaven. 
The lion checks at the sight of Androcles’s face. 
He then steals towards him; smells him; arches 
his back; purrs like a motor car; finally 
rubs himself against Androcles, knocking him 
over. Androcles, supporting himself on his 
wrist, looks affrightedly at the lion. The lion 
limps on three paws, holding up the other as if 
it zvas wounded. A flash of recognition lights 
up the face of Androcles. He flaps his hand 
as if it had a thorn in it, and pretends to pull the 
thorn out and to hurt himself. The lion nods 
repeatedly. Androcles holds out his hands to 
the lion, who gives him both paws, which he shakes 
with enthusiasm. They embrace rapturously, 
finally waltz round the arena amid a sudden burst 
of deafening applause, and out through the passage, 
the Emperor watching them in breathless astonish¬ 
ment until they disappear, when he rushes from his 
box and descends the steps in frantic excitement. 
the emperor. My friends, an incredible! an 
amazing thing! has happened. I can no longer 
doubt the truth of Christianity. [The Christians 
press to him joyfully]. This Christian sorcerer- 
[zvith a yell, he breaks off, as he sees Androcles 
and the lion emerge from the passage, waltzing. 
He bolts wildly up the steps into his box, and 
slams the door. All, Christians and gladiators

into the arena, the others in all directions. The 
place is emptied with magical suddenness ]. 

androcles [naively] Now I wonder why they all 
run away from us like that. [ The lion, combining 
a series of yawns, purrs, and roars, achieves some¬ 
thing very like a laugh], 

THE emperor [standing on a chair inside his box 
and looking over the wall] Sorcerer: I command 
you to put that lion to death instantly. It is 
guilty of high treason. Your conduct is most 
disgra - [the lion charges at him up the stairs] 
help! [He disappears. The lion rears against the 
box; looks over the partition at him; and roars. 
The Emperor darts out through the door and down 
to Androcles, pursued by the lion]. 

androcles. Dont run away, sir: he cant help 
springing if you run. [He seizes the Emperor and 
gets between him and the lion, who stops at once]. 
Dont be afraid of him. 

the emperor. I am not afraid of him. [The lion 
crouches, growling. The Emperor clutches Andro¬ 
cles]. Keep between us. 

androcles. Never be afraid of animals, your 
worship: thats the great secret. He’ll be as gentle 
as a lamb when he knows that you are his friend. 
Stand quite still; and smile; and let him smell 
you all over just to reassure him; for, you see, 
he’s afraid of you; and he must examine you 
thoroughly before he gives you his confidence. 
[To the lion] Come now, Tommy; and speak 
nicely to the Emperor, the great good Emperor

ANDROCLES AND THE LION 

who has power to have all our heads cut off if 
we dont behave very very respectfully to him. 

The lion utters a fearful roar. The Emperor 
dashes madly up the steps, across the landing, and 
down again on the other side, with the lion in hot 
pursuit. Androcles rushes after the lion; 
overtakes him as he is descending; and throws him¬ 
self on his hack, trying to use his toes as a brake. 
Before he can stop him the lion gets hold of the 
trailing end of the Emperor's robe. 
androcles. Oh bad wicked Tommy, to chase the 
Emperor like that! Let go the Emperor’s robe at 
once, sir: wheres your manners? [The lion growls 
and worries the robe]. Dont pull it away from 
him, your worship. He’s only playing. Now 
I shall be really angry with you, Tommy, if you 
dont let go. [The lion growls again]. I’ll tell you 
what it is, sir: he thinks you and I are not friends. 
the emperor [trying to undo the clasp of his 
brooch] Friends! You infernal scoundrel [the lion 
growls] - dont let him go. Curse this brooch! 
I cant get it loose. 

androcles. We mustnt let him lash himself into 
a rage. You must shew him that you are my 
particular friend - if you will have the con¬ 
descension. [He seizes the Emperor's hands and 
shakes them cordially]. Look, Tommy: the nice 
Emperor is the dearest friend Andy Wandy has 
in the whole world: he loves him like a brother.

little dog of a Greek tailor: I’ll have you burnt

I must serve the gods that are, not the God that

NOTES ON THE SPELLING 

The ‘transliteration’ was spelt in accordance with cer¬ 
tain guiding principles that had to be laid down in 
advance. Though it is claimed that the decisions taken 
were wise ones, there is nothing binding about the resul¬ 
tant spellings; it is merely proposed that the spellings 
here shown be looked upon as standard, unless and until 
others come to be widely preferred, and when good 
reasons can be found for making a change. 

(1) It is desirable that a given word should appear 
always in a given spelling and not vary from time to time. 
(This does not preclude individual writers from regularly 
using some spellings that differ from those in Androcles; 
it merely recommends consistency.) 

(2) It follows from (1) above that a choice of possible 
spellings has to be made in the case of those very common 
short words that are differently pronounced at different 
times by one speaker - those having what are called 
‘strong and weak forms’. The decision was taken in 
principle to spell such words with their fullest pronuncia¬ 
tion (since reduced forms can always be derived from 
fuller ones, whereas the converse is not possible). For 
the two kinds of exception to this, see (3) and (4) below. 

(3) word-signs. The design chosen to be the Shaw 
Alphabet has the characteristic feature incorporated in it 
of four ‘word-signs’ for the four most frequently occur¬ 
ring words of the language - the, of, and, to (it is estimated 
that one word in six is either the or of or and or to). 
These word-signs each consist of a single letter - that for 
the single sounds of th, v, n, and t respectively. The 
word-signs save valuable time and space. 

(4) the indefinite articles. The words a, an 


H3 


NOTES ON THE SPELLING 


NOTES ON THE SPELLING 


are here transliterated not to rhyme with day, Ann (which 
would be their ‘fuller’ pronunciation), but with the 
central, neutral, or shwa vowel actually heard in ‘a man’, 
‘aMother’. This has the advantage that the two words a, an 
can then be spelt with the same vowel - which would not 
otherwise be the case. Moreover, the ‘fuller’ pronuncia¬ 
tion of these two words is hardly ever used. This con¬ 
stitutes the second exception to the principle in (2) above. 

(5) Many English words have alternative pronuncia¬ 
tions, each speaker generally using one of them con¬ 
sistently, e.g. azure, subsidence, acoustic, controversy, 
laboratory, and countless others. Clearly, the principle 
in (1) above required that a choice be made. In general, 
individuals are of course at liberty to spell in con¬ 
formity with their own pronunciation. Alternative 
standard spellings of such words are likely to emerge; 
but until they do, the spellings in Androcles may be taken 
as standard. 

(6) It is obvious that the spellings in Androcles will 
fit the speech of some English-speaking people better 
than others. Nevertheless, it is claimed that none will 
find it hard to read from the spellings shown, i.e., to get 
the meaning from the printed page. It is to enable the 
greatest number of people to read from the spellings 
easily that words are in general written out in their fullest 
form (see (1) above), especially since most readers of 
Shavian are already readers of English in Roman letters, 
and since this will be their first experience of reading 
English in the new script. 

(7) It is for the reasons given in (1) and (6) above that 
the letter R is transliterated wherever it now occurs in 
Roman. The non-pronunciation of R in certain positions, 
which is characteristic of certain types of English speech, 
can easily be inferred from the spellings shown here - as 


it is now from our traditional orthography; but it would 
not be possible to deduce the pronunciation of R from 
a spelling which did not show it. Here again, the fuller 
form of words is the one shown, thus incidentally 
making the transliterated spellings more acceptable to, 
because conforming more closely to the speech of, a 
much larger number of speakers of English in all parts 
of the world. 

(8) Even so, the spellings in Androcles, while not 
committing anyone to specific qualities of sound (since 
each reader will read his own qualities, e.g. of vowel 
sound, into each different letter), do nevertheless commit 
to a particular distribution of sounds, and this distribution 
may be at variance with the usage of different speakers, 
not only with respect to the alternative pronunciations 
within a given type of English (see (5) above), but as 
between the usage in the various areas of the English- 
speaking world. It is probable that, for example, Ameri¬ 
can writers would favour other spellings in a number of 
instances, and that therefore further alternative spellings 
of some words will emerge. These are not likely to inter¬ 
fere greatly with the intelligibility of a text. It is in any 
case fitting that this first publication in an alphabet con¬ 
structed in accordance with Shaw’s wishes should show 
spellings in conformity with the kind of pronunciation 
he thought should be represented. 

note: It would be possible to extend the number of 
word-signs beyond the four provided for in the design. 
Thus, common words such as the following could regu¬ 
larly be spelt with a single consonant (the corresponding 
Roman letter is shown in brackets after each word): 
for (f), be (b), with (w), he (h), are (r), so (s), do (d). 
Further economies could be made by writing other com¬ 
mon words with two letters, omitting the vowel between 


J 44 


f 


145 


NOTES ON THE SPELLING 


initial and final consonants, e.g., that (tht), was (wz), 
have (hv), not (nt), this (ths), but (bt), from (fm), had (hd), 
has (hz), been (bn), were (wr), and so on. If such spellings 
became standardized, these invariable written forms 
would stand equally well for strong and weak forms in 
pronunciation, each reader supplying whichever he found 
appropriate in the context (which is what he does now). 
Naturally, it would always remain possible for a writer 
to indicate, by spelling out in full, any particular form he 
wished - to avoid ambiguity, or for the sake of emphasis, 
or in order to specify, for example in stage dialogue, 
some particular reading. For the reasons given in (6) 
above, Androcles has been transliterated without any 
abbreviations save those mentioned in (3) above. It is 
possible, however, that other abbreviations would come 
into use for private purposes but not for printing; it is 
also possible that some might come to be adopted in 
print as well.

SUGGESTIONS FOR WRITING 

1. While learning to form the letters, write larger than 
usual. Once their shapes are thoroughly mastered, 
letters will be written fast without undue distortion. 

A sheet of guide-lines can be inserted beneath 
your writing paper if you need them. 

2. Use pencil, or a bail-point pen, or a nib pen giving 
only slight variation of stroke-thickness. Test your 
pen and your size of writing on the eight small-curve 
letters out to err. If your pen is too broad to write 
these clearly, either change it or write larger. 

3. Cultivate an upright rather than a sloping hand¬ 
writing. It will be more like printed letterpress and 
more distinguishable. 

4. Make Tall and Deep letters about twice the height 
of Shorts, to allow for the inexactitudes of free 
handwriting. 

5. Leave ample space between words. Write the letters 
of each word closely together. Avoid linking letters 
unnaturally. 

There is no need to link letters at all. But it 
frequently happens that the end of one letter 
naturally runs into the beginning of another; and 
the alphabet is so designed that this cannot produce 
alternative readings. 

Junctions or links can occur only along one of the 
double guide-lines (used or imagined) within which 
Short letters are written. No links are permissible 


146 


H 7 


SUGGESTIONS FOR WRITING 

between the guide-lines, nor above them, nor 
beneath them. 

Fast writers are likely to make such natural 
junctions as these: 

h\i <\\A\ 1 old 7\\jtnrt.\ 

diW /d /C y.cl yoM 

- in which it is easy to recognize these separate 

letters, and no others: 

vai /"lull 1 cifid 7\\Jlnm Cw\. (h rpm. 

difid /tl /ic gvcl /oSl /iq 3‘ipfi. 

6. Be sure to distinguish properly between these Short 
letters: 

jsr \\\. vr giyr 

7. While taking care, avoid over-anxiety. Avoid cramped 
fingers and heavy pressure of pen on paper. Only 
with a light touch will you write well, freely, and fast. 
As soon as hand or brain is fatigued, take a rest. 

Little and often — but very often; that is the way 
to practise. You can practise on a newspaper’s margin 
as happily as doing its crosswords. Earnest practice 
for a single week enables one to write with assurance 
if not with speed. You will be surprised at the brevity 
and simplicity of Shavian writing. 

8. Re-read your practice writing. Learn by your own 
writing and spelling slips. Make sure that a reader 
would not hesitate. 

9. If you have already learnt to read this book’s Shavian 
pages without reference to any key, you will have no 
difficulty in spelling when you write. 

10. This is a good first exercise in spelling and writing: 
From the Writers’ Alphabet take the first pair of 

148 


SUGGESTIONS FOR WRITING 

letters (consonants) and, from its righthand column, 
the first three pairs (vowels). Write down all the 
words these will make. A few minutes will show 
you how simple spelling is, and you will have 
mastered once for all the shapes of eight letters. 

11. You can be perfectly understood without spelling 
quite ‘like a book’. We shall all tend to spell words 
as we see them printed; but nobody should complain 
so long as spelling is intelligible. To communicate - 
more easily, sensibly, economically - is the whole 
purpose of Shavian writing. 

12. Mutual encouragement helps. Interest yourself and 
fellow writers by joining an ‘ever-circulator’ as 
page 15 invites you to do. It is the way to get
